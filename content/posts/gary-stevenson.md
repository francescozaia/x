In 2011, while working as a City trader, Gary Stevenson ([@garyseconomics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Ghe5TBQGYIOANuiNW4hDQ)) joined the ultra rich with a single bonus cheque. Not long after he was named one of Citibank’s highest performing traders worldwide. Stevenson made millions for his employer by betting on one thing: that the British and American economies would fail to recover from the global financial crisis, that inequality would only get worse and living standards would stagnate. That made him rich, but miserable. Which is why Gary would later leave his job to campaign on inequality. 

In this interview he discusses his personal story - from studying at the LSE to the working culture of one of the world’s biggest banks - to what the economics of the 2020s will look like, and how the plan is to destroy the middle class.

_I look at economic analysis in the media that is not analysis that is an entertainment product if you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right and punishing them for being wrong then they are not analyzing they are [ __ ] dancing_

...

A: Everybody knows the inequality is getting worse well almost everybody anybody serious anyway for Gary Stevenson that is the essential Trend not just the last 15 years the next 15 years too not that long ago Gary was one of the most successful Traders on the planet now he's a campaigner around inequality though he still does the occasional trade as well Gary it's great to have you joining us on Downstream

G: Thank you

A: We've got a lot to talk about um we'll start right from the beginning age 22 in 2008 you got a job as a Trader at Citigroup and Carrie Wharf within two years you made your first million pounds and that's a position that a lot of young people aspire to but you started from a very humble beginnings so can you walk us through your story where you come from the the Gary Stevenson kind of narrative Arc

G: yeah okay so I'm from ilford which is a small suburb of East London uh yeah I come from a pretty poor background um little Terrace house next to the railway got uh one brother one sister um I was always very good at math growing up um so I think if you grew up in East London you know when I was a kid we could literally see the the skyscrapers in Canary Wharf going up we were kids um you kind of assume you’re going to go into banking right so that was sort of the path I thought I'd go on. I got expelled from school when I was 16 for uh I normally call it a drug related incident 

A: What was it?

G: It was about cannabis yeah you know

A: You were expelled?

G: Yeah yeah 16
A: just for smoking cannabis?
G: uh I think I sold about two pounds worth of cannabis

A: okay

G: yeah which I wouldn't call it a sale but um yeah I was young and I don't condone such things, but it happened back then so I was sort of stuck at home give me a bit of a kick up the ass and also studied for my exams but I did one of my exams and uh you know managed to get good at levels and went to go to LSE. So, LSE I don't know ~if you know people Melody~  it's a bit of a London School of Economics it's a bit of a Investment Banking boot camp um and I kind of figured I'd just go there kill the exams I'll study maths in economics and get a job as a Trader

A: But that is super hard

G: well exactly what makes you get the job

A: no Maths for a degree is because I know people that did maths at the NSC and they were really good math students at a level or whatever, but University level math is incredibly demanding I mean you must be really good at maths

G: maths is it was my thing as a kid. I won a few competitions nothing's my thing as a kid um it's just sort of the way my mind works um but I thought I could just go and just kill the mass exams and get a job um but I remember sort of coming back second year and suddenly everyone at LSE is just they start talking in acronyms cds's M&A's MBOs you know CDOs, IBD and I was thinking what is going on I didn't know anything and I spoke to a friend and he was like yeah you have to apply for 35 internships and you have to you hope you get one and then that's how you get a job. And um all of these guys you know LSR is like literally full of like kids of like Russian oligarchs and the Chinese politburo you know it's like International billionaires and the Crystal and it'll be like prepping from when they were kids that all like they'd all like started a charity you know and checked through the Sahara Desert

A: how long did it take you to work this out of the LSC how long did it take you to work out okay the people I'm now studying with at University it's not like the creme de La Creme of the kids at school which was what you think it is before you go to university but it's actually people I've never met before

G: I remember I was in the math department which is a bit of sort of you know what Mass guys I like and we went online sort of away day like very early on and I brought like a two liter bottle of like white lightning Cider on the coach and I was like put some sides it almost look at me like I was insane and I remember thinking this is not like what I saw in the movies um but I was to be honest when I was a kid I was like man on a mission I'm going to get this job nothing's going to stop me and that's why it was quite dispiriting to realize that basically you have to send all these series and cover letters and everyone you've got to fluff it with all this stuff right like I played clarinet at the Royal Albert Hall you know what I mean this kind of stuff and literally I was fluffing pillows at DFS that's all I had you know I tried to be a Grime rapper you know you can't put that on your CV you know I had a little jacket with cadaverous crew written on the back of it but like so I was thinking how am I going to get this job basically and I I didn't know what to do so I just figured like I didn't make a single application because I knew I would never beat these guys on CV and cover letter like there's nothing literally I'm fluffing fluffing pillows ~the DFS in Vector~ you know I'm not going to get a job with that so I figured I'll just like try and kill these exams and like be very sort of like loud about it and hope somebody notices and basically somebody did notice because a guy from new above said just I never even met the guy came out to me in the library one day and he said Citibank Cars one Trader you through a card game it's a math game you win that game you can get a job and I was sort of my ears picked up because it's like maths I'm good at maths I'm good at games so let's just do this right and explain like the rules of the game to me and then I went to the competition I won the LSC round and then I basically just stopped going lectures and I just all I did was study this one game which was like a stupid little math game

A: what was the game it's like a card game?

G: it's like a poker Style game they make basically like everyone has a card and there's another three cards in the middle and you just you essentially you make bets using a trading style mechanism of what the sum total of everyone's cards will be

A: so it's probabilities basically

G: well this is actually interesting you say that because the the way I won the game was I knew that all the Majesty guys would just calculate the statistical expected value which meant that if someone had a higher card they'd quote higher prices and if someone had a low card they'd quote low prices and you could just buy sell Buy sell buy sell and it's kind of it's amazing it was that easy and and other people probably should have realized what I was doing but I think this is I think another thing which has sort of benefited me throughout my career because of the way that I look in the way that I sound I think people just thought I was [ __ ] an idiot basically doing mad stuff like but it was easy they were playing the numbers and I was playing the game basically so um I won that competition and The Madness of it is what that meant was you know all these other guys who'd be like learning all these acronyms you know and sort of talking to like you know they were in the investment Society in the finance site going to all these events and here's me turning up on my internship I didn't know anything I didn't know a single acronym I didn't know anything like that um and the maddest thing of it all is the Traders [ __ ] loved it they loved me turning up like some kid from down the road like just like I don't know anything but teach me and I'll do it you know what I mean and um I think it kind of you know there's this myth of like the Cockney wide boy trailer um but I don't exist

A: the Barrow boy

G: exactly yeah you go there nowadays and it's all just um you know it's Rich guys from Rich families is that so it's the same sort of international money the league that goes to lse you know what I mean it's you know there's some sort of Blue Blue Bloods and oxfords and cambridges but it's you know the Coney and MIT and it's all these just Rich guys from Rich family so I think they saw me turn up just like only just 

A: for viewers as a university Milan
B: and a finance University man it's like the Italian LSE essentially yeah um yeah so they loved it and I turned up and um then the financial crisis happened just after I started and then within a few years I was the most profitable Trader in the bank which um which I guess we'll talk about had happened the City Bank yeah City Bank yeah

A: you you start this great job off the back of winning a card game yeah an amazing story and it's like I'm expecting a Netflix film about this

G:yeah it will come

A: yeah I suspect so you go to work at Citibank you walk in first day what's that like?

G: trading feels a big place um I remember I remember getting the train to Canary Wharf and the Jubilee line makes this sort of like whooping sound it's not like the trains that go past my window um yeah remember they walked me in I remember just seeing like massive massive floor I think the big thing that hits you about the trade the floor is all these screens it's like every trade has like a wall of like nine screens massive Water Screens like that and um they walked me around and they sort of sat me down um introduced me to the to the boss of the desk and um the boss is high and then he just ignores you right and you sort of you're sitting there nobody says anything because this is the thing that a very common experience when you start on trading draws is everyone says hi and then they just totally ignore you and it's kind of your job to like get seen basically and then you sort of start poking around like can I eat your coffee can I get your tea um can I go get your lunch and that sort of that's like weirdly like I think I sort of just started just getting everyone's lunch for them yeah and I remember this one interview but you're an interest rate Trader well I mean at first I was just an intern right so you're just an intern so you've got no specific you're just an intern you need to get them to hire you to the desk basically right and I remember I just used to try and get everybody lunch I remember sort of one of my first on my one of my first days I got a load of people lunch and I took a little note of like how much everybody's lunch cost and then I put the the change on the table exact exact change next to the trader who paid for the lunches and the trader just he just looked at it you know like when somebody dropped some coins and people just look he looked at the money and he was like what's that and I was like it's a change and he was like it just didn't say anything I was like uh it's like four pound Thirty One and just slid it across the desk into his little drawer and he looked at me right in the face and he said on this desk we keep the change like that like and I was thinking these guys are [ __ ] mad basically um but that works basically and then you know I started getting you know I've got a lot of lunches um eventually they sent me to get like lunch for everyone on the floor I think no it was it was this kind of game dynamic because they knew that I wasn't from that space and they kind of loved it and they were like played little games with me so like on the end of my internship they sent me to buy burgers for everyone the whole trading floor which is like [ __ ] 500 people or something right just call me over Gary all right today I'm buying lunch everyone on the floor and I knew they wanted me to be like [ __ ] myself I was like yeah fine so I did it you know I had to like get everyone involved and then when I came back I sat down after delivering Burgers they were on the floor and they called me Gary Gary you got a passport and I was like yeah so go home and get it you're going skiing and that was like honestly the funniest thing about that was I didn't even realize when you went skiing that you were in mountains you went to the top of the mountains and I was like [ __ ] you know it was mad I remember texting my dad where's my passport on the train so what did you think you were going like cross-country skiing or something I just I only knew like Milton Keynes no scent is the only thing I could think of I just thought it was like on a field or something yeah where I'm from you don't people don't go skiing you know what I mean I didn't know about that um but then that was how I got the job and then 2008 I'll start full time that was when I became like a full-time Trader and then as soon as I hit that desk the crisis happened and that was sort of so when do you start because obviously it's to the best of my recollection now it's basically August September things really hot up in 2008 that's like June 30th 2008. so it's just a couple of months before things go bang yeah yeah basically and um I had no idea what was going on but the the crazy thing was that this guy worked on which was short-term interest rates which is basically short-term loans was a very unfashionable desk previous they literally made loans of like one day which is like not a massively profitable business right um and in the credit crisis 2008 it blew up it became unbelievably profitable so like they had it really attracted all these sort of new school like Yale Harvard types you know with all of these like Immaculate like shirts with a little monogram on it it was all sort of old school Traders and they suddenly they were making a ton of money and um I was just thinking how do I get me some of this money basically how do I follow these guys um and just desperately trying to get them to tell me what are you doing how are you making this money you're like what's happening I was trying to figure it out um and uh it turned out so a lot of what they were doing was basically it was an American bank and they were lending out loads and loads of dollars and it was super profitable because everybody needed dollars and the Citibank at this point is the biggest bank in the world yeah at that point yeah yeah so they were lending a ton of dollars and I remember sort of I figured out what they were doing I learned to 10 dollars too and then I was there was one guy who I worked with who was like it was a scout so he was from Liverpool he didn't go to university and after I put my first big trade on I went home and I thought oh [ __ ] what if this trade goes wrong so I went in next morning I spoke to this guy this scouse guy and he said um I said what's the risk in this trade and he said to me this trade will lose money if the global banking system blows up in which case you'll lose your job and I'll lose my job and it'll be the end of [ __ ] everything but that's not going to happen so we're going to make a ton of money so you just cross your fingers and I hope it works out um so the first couple years all I did was that basically just lend these dollars and that was super profitable in 2008 2009. then in 2010 that stopped being profitable I remember this weird thing happened the Swiss National Bank did something that [ __ ] me and I lost like eight million dollars in a week and that's when I realized like it's not really free money like that and I have to start figuring out like a smarter way to make money so your first year 2008 you make 400 000 pounds be clear for yourself personally something like that now oh no that was that was so 2000 I started in June 2008 yeah um to 2009 my boss who fought who hired me quit basically in the middle of the year and um how come hey I think you made so much money in 2008 that like he just thought I'm going to quit I'm going to like live the dream I'm gonna like build my house in California and that's a whole other story which we can get into but um he quit and uh he said to me you can ask me anything you want and I said what do I need to do to make a hundred grand for the bank at that age so I would have been 20 just turned 22 100 Grand in my mind was like the most money you could make like in a year basically 100 bonus because it's not possible you need to make 10 million dollars for the bank he said I said all right I went back put one massive bet on 12 million dollars one of the year and then yeah and I was expected to get paid a bonus of like 100 Grand and I remember going to the meeting room and it was like just under 400 Grand on the piece of paper and I remember looking and just being like I remember like it was yesterday's my boss was a massive guy and I pointed at the number and I thought it must be another number I pointed the number and I said is it that and he said yeah and I literally said well that's a lot of money how old are you just turn 23. um and I think what is weird about that you know there'll be people who hear that story and they'll be like that's fantastic that's amazing like kid from poor background made a ton of money that's really really good and it and it is good and you know I wouldn't be able to afford to do what I do now if it wasn't for that but the actual experience of it was like weirdly quite traumatic I remember see like if I had about 100 Grand I would have gone home to my parents to be like I've got 100 Grand I would tell my mate so I got 100 grand um yeah I would have told my girlfriend over 100 Grand but like 400 Grand just seemed like an inhuman amount of money it felt like the kind of money that you couldn't tell anyone about it felt like I felt like how can I tell my I went out and I sat down next to this guy whilst I worked this girl sky and you could see I was upset and he said go out and like sit down and I remember just thinking like I think about my dad you know what I mean he worked my dad worked for post office for 35 years and he was probably never making much more than 20 grand and he used to start work he used to leave the house at like 5 a.m and the train needs to go past the back of my house and my mum would wake me up and we'd try and look at him like wave at him going past the house and obviously that's dark you know you see him and you think about how hard he worked day after day after day for 20 grand a year and then here's me just 10 23 sit at a desk you know for a year 400 Grand it just seemed like you're all a sudden different to everybody you knew right how you're sort of disconnected exactly it's that that is 100 Grand is like gift 400 Grand that buys you out of your family buys you out of your friend group I remember like I went around my mate's house and we were playing like Pro Evo and um they're all talking a lot a lot of them worked in finance oh did you get a bonus oh yeah I got five grand I I got like seven Grand and then one of them said did you get a bonus and I hadn't told anyone and I just thought you know what these are like my closest friends I'm just gonna [ __ ] tell them right so I told him I got 395 Grand and you could just like hear like the silence I fill the room of this like this like shock and it was almost and then it started to feel like it started to feel like a cruel thing to tell people in a weird way I made this amount of money and it was a and it's I know it's bizarre but I think in a weird way it was a cruel thing to happen to me and I know that sounds crazy but it's just that level of inequality should and you know I made a lot more than that in following years you know what I mean but like it shouldn't exist it shouldn't happen you know what I mean it shouldn't and it's it's don't get me wrong right I think that people who work hard are natality and do good things should make money I think we should live in a world where that is possible 100 but like people like me and people where I'm from didn't even know that 400 grams I think somebody could make I had no idea and and then like I was thinking if I've made 400 Grand what if the rest of these [ __ ] make you know what I mean I was just looking around me thinking like what is going on so yeah it was it was a it was a mud experience you were City's most profitable Trader globally at one point is that correct yeah so that was 2011. so basically like so this is after you've lost the money from yeah so this sort of just lending the dollar stopped working basically and I had to realize I had to think that we're gonna have to we're gonna have to figure out a smarter way to make money and um so the history of this is actually quite interesting right so what was an interest rate Trader we're going to get a bit technical here but we'll keep it simple um so in 2008 all the interest rates in the in the rich World collapsed to zero because Central Bank Cuts rates we want to boost the economy the economy is really [ __ ] so everybody cut their rates and then our job became basically to bet on when will rates go up again and rates will go up when the economy recovers you know that's a simplification but you know that's basically what happens and interest rate stays Zero from 2008 until this year basically 2022 which is 14 years and in every single one of those years markets and economies predicted that rates would go up the next year which was wrong 12 13 years in a row which is interesting right like these are the best paid guys in the world to do this thing and they're wrong year after this is like if you studied you know weather forecasting at Uni and you went to work at like the met and you saw that every single year every single day they're like tomorrow's going to be like sunny and 30 degrees you know and they're always wrong so you know this happened in 2008 and they were like it'll get better next year it didn't 2009 the lock code was quite serious maybe next year 2010 The RK world just give it one more year and sort of by sort of late 2010 I've seen these guys be wrong for two and a half years and I I started to think like maybe they're just wrong maybe there isn't a recovery I think the big thing for me was because I came from a poor background and you know I still have the same friends the same family I I could see that things were getting actively worse for people from where I'm from and it was like well how do you expect the idea between cutting behind cutting interest rates is you get people spending money all because you can borrow money cheap you know it's great spend money but I look at the situation of my friends and family that I grew up with these guys are losing their homes right their parents had property they'll never owned property so they're getting they're getting poor year after year how the [ __ ] are they going to start spending money because you give them access to a cheap loan they don't even get access to that money they can't go and borrow money at zero percent you know what I mean so I started to look at this and I started to think I don't see it happening I don't see it happen and I guess I was in this sort of quite unique position because there's not many people that go from poor backgrounds to working in trading nowadays so I could see what it was like for ordinary people and I could also see what it was like for these rich guys working in the city you know it's a bunch of millionaires working she used to think because you started in 2008 you had no sort of Prior expectations whereas somebody has been in the industry 25 years they've seen lots of ups and downs and so there's going to be a bunch of cognitive biases where they say I was here in the mid 80s I was here in the early 90s oh it's here for.com this is just the same but actually you didn't have any of that because yeah this is all you know I guess they're used to interest rates up and down they weren't used to this sort of flat lining I think um but you know I think if you consider how long that went on for you know even at the beginning of 2020 people were still predicting rates going to go up later that year you know that's 12 years 12 years of incorrect predictions incredible I think that I think that's you know we could have a whole discussion about why is that happened and you know I went back to Oxford 2017 2019 and I asked one of the professors we had electoral interest rates um and I went up to him afterwards and I said why do you think we were so we were wrong on this interest rates for so long and he said oh no we always knew rates would stay zero and I was like I didn't know what to say to that because you know this is my job you know I know for the fact that these guys predicted interest rates would go back up every single year and I didn't I was like no you didn't it was like yeah we knew we knew I just said well I'm gonna go home I'm going to send you the data and then we're going to talk about 2017 he said that yeah 2017. even you had Janet Yellen before then putting up U.S interest rates in like 2014 2015 they were saying oh we're gonna try and yeah which eventually came down again yeah and I said so I said in the data and it was oh that's interesting yeah we have been wrong for 10 years and here's a guy right professor of macroeconomics Oxford University he's been wrong for 10 years not only has he been wrong for 10 years in a row he's not realized that he's done that that is the level we are at here of Economics where and and but look at this guy rich guy Rich family he used to wear a nice snakeskin belt you know what I mean he doesn't get hurt does he this guy's wrong 10 years in a row you know of course he never gets hurt of course he doesn't notice you know I mean I always you know I wrote some articles at the beginning of covert saying like this is going to cause a massive increase in inequality it's going to cause a massive increase in house prices it's going to cause a massive inflationary crisis okay at the same time Larry Elliott Like Chief economics editor at the guardian was right and house Bryce are going to collapse okay that was obviously wrong who's punishing Larry Elliott you know what I mean but while wait so at the beginning of covid yeah because that there was briefly a there was briefly a buyer's market because you did have lots of people with like student homes buy to let landlords they just thought you know what this is going to be unoccupied for God knows how long yeah the margins are low you should get rid so you got you did get a big flood of those properties for a brief moment yeah about three four months I remember and it was less that the market fell there was just uncertainty so you could get real value yeah but I think what people were missing was we knew at the beginning of kovid the government is going to give a [ __ ] ton of money out and in the end the government gave out 600 billion pounds which I want to emphasize is 12 000 pounds for every single adult in the country okay that's how much money the government gave out okay and if anyone was bothered to do the analysis which basically nobody was you could see very quickly that that money is going to go overwhelmingly to richest people in the country you could work that out we could go through the logic of that right there's a video on my YouTube where I explained exactly you could see 600 billion pounds gonna go to the richest people in the country they're gonna [ __ ] buy houses what the [ __ ] how's they going to do with it you know that we're literally talking about 100 200 Grand per person of course that's price is going to go and I think there's this real I think the big problem is number one there's very few economies from poor backgrounds right so then they're not really keyed into what's happening and number two they don't get punished if they're wrong they don't get punished if they're wrong they don't get rewarded if they're right this sort of punishment would you like them to see because obviously you mean you mean they be they lose legitimacy and there's no counter incentives right if you're if you're right you get loads of States looking for these guys to be spanked in the streets right yeah at least be acknowledged that they were wrong you know no one even said you know this guy at Oxford University wrong for 10 years didn't even notice you know what I mean at least have you know I I'm from a poor background right I walk onto the trading field within two years I'm famous because I'm the guy who gets it right you know I've been writing articles for like two and a half years now about covid and I'm and you know go go remarkable to the beginning of code with every single thing I said would happen has happened you know but you know I don't get the attention that Larry Elliot gets he's wrong in all his predictions you know and the problem is if you don't have any mechanism by which people who are consistently right get recognized and people who are consistently wrong get shown up for being wrong then you will get [ __ ] analysis of course you will it's obvious isn't it and not only that but it is inevitable you'll end up with the Posh boys club because if you have no mechanism by which people who actually understand but are from don't have the social capital can challenge people who are just chatting [ __ ] but do have the social capital then you will just end up help you know how am I going to people how people are going to find my article you know what I mean you know whereas in the city I could walk into any skyscraping Canary wolf and get paid a million pound a year because these guys will look at my track record and say this guy keeps getting it right so actually there's more of a sort of meritocratic attitude 100 city than in journalism or Academia there is no meritocracy in media and to be honest in my opinion I look at economic analysis in the media that is not analysis that is an entertainment product if you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right and punishing them for being wrong then they are not analyzing they are [ __ ] dancing that's what they're doing you know like if you want them to be right pay them to be [ __ ] right but we're not doing that are we we're not doing that and and if you think at the same time right imagine you are an economist who's good who's really good you know what's happening right you can write an article that's perfectly right and no one will ever [ __ ] read it or you can go and work for [ __ ] Bank of America and get paid a million pound a year you know that is the system that we've built and then we're surprised that the economy goes to [ __ ] you know if you want if you want good analysis at the very least recognize good analysis this nobody's even checking the homework here crazy there is some to well I agree with you entirely but Financial Times certain journalists instead Ambrose Evans Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the telegraph for instance is really good on Russia and the long-term consequence of what's going on there generally speaking I entirely agree with you and like you say the incentives are much harder to shut your Gob and just make loads of money and the incentives aren't there to actually have top top Finance journalists and I agree with you at the BBC which of course is where most people get their media in the UK in most newspapers you might as well not bother being quote unquote informed because you're not being informed but there are some good sources of news surely because you yourself must consume new sources on this stuff so where are they um to be totally honest what I do more than anything else is our trade and I talk to Traders listen there must be there must be there must be creditable but there must be more credible news sources that at least some legitimacy is given to blogs podcasts you tell me there are good individuals you have good individuals who have good analysis um I I was never really a news reader I hired the guy to sit next to me and read the papers and and tell me like what's because that's a great job as a Trader you need to know what people think yeah because as a Trader you don't make money just by being right you make money by being right specifically when other people are wrong so it's actually like the art of understanding the way in which people are wrong you know what I mean by that because if everybody knows something it's not monetized it's not valuable exactly yeah um to be honest I mean I watch the news now largely because I've moved away from purely financial analysis and now I'm in I'm in a space where what I want to do is explain to people what's happening to change the way that they view it and the way that they act so I need to know what you're being told so I can explain to you why it's wrong there are good people who do good analysis there's oh I forget the names now there's the Norwegian guy the financial times I spoke to him should remember his name he's quite good um but to be honest when it comes to economics like I I trade I trade that's what I do in terms of long-term Market signals in terms of political risk and you think this might happen or this might happen where are you where are you saying oh that's good information then so I talk to Traders the long-term implications for instance of uh Russia's invasion of Ukraine and what that means for the kinds of the kind of Trades you you'd be involved in yeah clearly you need to source of information about that because you're not in Ukraine um yeah I mean I think it's important basically to know what you know about what you don't know about I think that actually in my opinion the economic significance the more Ukraine is obviously a terrible thing right but the economic significance of it in this country I think has been significantly overplayed in my opinion I think that the inflation that we're seeing is specifically in energy markets of course it's affected the energy markets right but you know look what's happening to London housing look what's happening to London rents that you know Vladimir Putin didn't do that you know and I've been saying for the beginning of kovid yeah we're gonna we give me 600 billion pounds to rich people if you don't expect an inflation in Christ after that then you don't understand money so you would put let's say we're well we're we're at 10 now and and we don't know where we're going it was scheduled to go significantly higher we don't know because there's a big intervention from government you would say actually the inflation we're seeing in this country is more to do with quantitative easing and printing money than Vladimir Putin I would say it's to do with the the very large government deficit during covid and who ended up with that money I think people people don't realize that there's two sides of the balance sheet right if the government gives that 600 billion pounds then somebody gets 600 billion pounds 600 billion pounds is a [ __ ] a lot of money right that's 12 000 pounds per adult in the entire country so if you don't have 12 000 pounds more cash now than you had three years ago someone's got your 12 000 pounds that's a lot of [ __ ] money and if you you know if we assume that that all went to top 10 right which I think is a good sort of first order approximation that means every single adult in the top 10 richest people in the country getting 120 Grand cash that [ __ ] happened you know and and where did that cash go well they're gonna well I think the thing is the interesting thing is you can't get rid of it once it's out there right it only circulates right so they're gonna first thing they do is they try and buy assets because that's what rich people do so that's why we saw this massive boom in the stock market that's why we saw these massive movement house prices but the thing about that is that doesn't get rid of the money right I try and buy your house you try and buy my house we're just topping the money between us so the prices go up what you will see is some richer people buying the houses of poorer people and that will often happen generationally so for example a lot of my friends on poorer backgrounds who've been like saving up really hard 70 80 grand deposits nowadays you can't buy a house with 78 Grand deposit in London suddenly they're competing with the kids of richer families their parents giving them their 300 Grand and then so they don't get the house so what you see is generationally houses that would have been bought by kids from poor families are now being bought by kids from richer family so you do see a lot of asset ownership in the pool but essentially the money doesn't disappear it just circulates if the government gives money out until the government taxes it back people will have more money and the big question is who will have more money and that is the question that nobody was asking during Kobe do you think Constable was a mistake then because obviously that that creation of more money isn't just a response to covert that's been the default alongside low interest rates since 2008. that's a really good question and my answer is actually no and I think that might surprise some people when I say what I said that you know inflation was caused by the government giving money out and by the low interest rates you might think that I'm opposed to the government giving money out of low interest rates I'm not the government had to do that I'm not opposed to follow at all I'm not opposed to the massive deficits the government ran during covid at all those had to be done otherwise people have literally died right people would have not paid the rent people would become homes we would have not been able to eat had to be done but at the same time if you're giving out 600 billion pounds you have to do an analysis of who's going to end up with this money and if that analysis had been done then we would have seen well we're injecting a [ __ ] massive amount of money to the rich hit a massive amount and then you know we had the period of lockdown when that money wasn't damaging because the rich couldn't really spend it because they're locked at home right we could have used that one and a half years two years to say okay we have to do this thing which is going to make the rich [ __ ] Rich so we use the time we have to work out a way to tax them effectively to take that money back you know if you give 600 billion pounds to the rich and you don't want to see effect you have to find ways to take that money back and we had a year and a half where we could have had a sensible conversation about okay look covered [ __ ] we had to do this thing and it's going to massively increase inequality we need to figure out how to stop that from happening and we didn't have that conversation because nobody was talking about who's going to end up with this money so the problem is not that the money was given out and the problem is not the low interest rates the problem is we have an economic system here that is very happy to give tons of money to the rich and has no mechanism of reliably getting money from the rich that is [ __ ] not sustainable and what the thing that really worried me now you see Energy prices going up what's the solution 150 billion pounds direct from the government to the energy companies so if you believe my analysis that the government deficit and increasing inequality caused inflation their solution is another massive government deficit that will increase inequality and I went out and I sold a [ __ ] on the government bonds because I was like these guys are trying to fix inflation with inflation listen you need to have the systemic ability to take wealth away from rich people because there's a massive systemic Force to give wealth to rich people if every time there's a crisis you give a [ __ ] ton to the rich and you have no mechanism of taking money back from the rich then you will impoverish and bankrupt your government and your [ __ ] middle class and we're seeing it in front of our eyes and what frustrates what frustrates me the most is just a lack of a discussion of listen we Encore video gave him 600 billion pounds with no mechanism of getting it back from them well we've actually just reduced their taxes I mean that is I mean that was the one of the maddest things I've seen in my life and um yeah I mean but when I saw that I I got very emotional when I saw that when I saw that you know and this is for you and for me right when I saw that I thought this is because me and people like me have not explained clearly enough to the people of this country that if the government gives you 10 pounds and the rich a thousand pounds you are getting poorer because in kovid the average family accumulated like one two grand cash and every Rich family accumulated like 300 Grand cash okay and that had the obvious predictable consequences right money is not real resources if I give you 100 quid and him 100 Grand you have gotten poorer so after covid people had more money explain that because they would say no we both got richer but okay so they've just got much Rich than I have let's break this down about money is not food money is not energy money is not housing money is not Health Care okay if we give everybody money we have not increased the amount of actual resources and assets we have in our society okay so you don't make Society richer by giving people money you make Society richer by creating and having more resources and assets so if I give everybody more money all that happens is the prices go up but if I give you a bit of money and him a lot of money then he gets richer and you get poorer because you have a bit more money but the prices have gone up relative to both of your increases in in money so I think this is the thing I want and the reason I'm hammering this down is because they did that in covert and they got away with it and to be honest the the conservative government lucked out with the Ukraine war because that took the entire blame for the inflation which in my opinion was caused by their massive increasing inequality and because they got away with it I I'm not surprised to see them do it again because what they did in the tax cuts was quite interesting right they cut the taxes on Ordinary People by a little bit like 50 Quid a month and that's the basic let's just put our audience yes we've got a bunch of tax cuts here so corporation tax didn't go up we'll park that for a moment the basic rate which we all pay cut by one percent but that benefits wealthier people far more than ordinary people well yeah they cut the basic rate by one percent it doesn't really give you that much more money it's like 50 Quid a month you know and only if you're like like a higher midlearn if you're a low mid learner it doesn't benefit you at all right but they cut your taxes a tiny bit and then they cut the taxes of millionaires by like 50 Grand and then my mate called me up he's from an ordinary background and I was explaining it to him and he was like you know I think my mates might be happy because they got this 50-grid tax cut right and people need to understand if the government gives you 50 Quid and the rich 50 Grand you will have more money and you'll get less food less energy less housing less healthcare because money is the asset that we use to determine the distribution of real assets money does not make people Rich money is how we determine distribution you can have as much money as you want right if it doesn't buy you housing if it doesn't buy you food it doesn't matter it doesn't matter does it so people need to understand that because the government has struck on this idea here where we give every poor person a bit of cash I mean give every rich person a ton of cash and then the end result is prices go up to a ton and ordinary people that don't understand why they're getting poorer why because I've got more money why is it happening and it's not just the inflation obviously like you said wealthy people they don't need to spend money they've already got loads of money so they've pumped that into assets and then of course the assets are generally ways for them to make more money because they're living off the revenues from those assets and of course that's the rent here is and that poor people find themselves subjects yeah I always say this you know we talk about sugar down economics if you give the money that their wealth career is like the [ __ ] Gandalf or something right if we give the money they'll boost the economy listen if you give these guys money they're gonna [ __ ] buy your mom's house that is what they're going to do listen my friends mums had houses and my friends will never have houses those houses are not [ __ ] disappearing those houses are owned by rich people's kids now that is what this means this is ordinary families losing their [ __ ] homes and they will they will never have houses again their kids won't have houses they're grandkids that is what this this is serious you cannot give all of your assets away and expect not to be poor not only that but we're giving the assets away to this group of rich people who are internationally mobile and don't pay any [ __ ] taxes I think it's it's you know I was not born and raised political I do this because it was my job to look into the future and tell you what is going to happen to the economy if we do not find a way to tax rich people seriously the future of this economy is going to be a disaster it's going to be a disaster because the government's going further into debt ordinary families are losing their homes all they know families going further into debt and the homes are going to the rich and the deadest of the Rich and it's as you say what that means then is you pay more rent to the rich you pay higher mortgages to the rich so as inequality gets bigger the cash flows from ordinary families to the rich get bigger which means inequality will get bigger still so it creates this really negative spiral you know this is all it's not an optimistic Outlook but that is why I do what I do and but the thing that is most maddening is and also the thing which can give us a bit of Hope is it's fixable because those assets have not disappeared they are owned by the rich and if we fix our tax system we can we can we can get them given back to ordinary families you've got a quote here which I'm going to refer to you've been a successful Trader we've talked about that you're academically credentialed we talked about that I mean it helps to be good in both Fields because then people can't try and discredit you uh you did maths and economics at the lse and for like you say at Oxford but you've said quote throw your textbooks in the bin if you want to really learn about economics so you've already talked about that one academic who's thought it wasn't a serious guy you're basically saying look if you want to know what the story is don't bother with the sort of fussy Dons that these allegedly top universities yeah that is a line from this scouse Trader I used to work with who is the only Trader I worked with didn't go to university he's for Liverpool and he worked on the cash desk when he was 18 and he worked his way up to being like the top Trader at Citibank and I was a Citibank stock Trader in 2011 and he was Citibank stock Trader in 2008 2009 2010 2012 2013. this guy was a [ __ ] genius and when I got smashed that when I lost eight million dollars at one week I bought my instinct as a good economic student was to go and bring my textbooks in and start reading it and being like what's happening he came up to me just [ __ ] grabbed him and he threw him in the bin and he was like listen how [ __ ] old are you and I was out there 23 24 whatever you are not going to learn about it from those [ __ ] books you want to learn about the economy go out onto the street you know walk down the High Street see what shops are closing down look at what the adverts are on the tube you know what I mean is there more homeless people that you're seeing ask your mum about her financial situation ask your friends and your friends mums about their financial situation that is the [ __ ] economy and look I'm not saying nobody should study economics all right but you you should be using your study of Economics to get you into a situation where you can analyze the real world and I'm going to use an example to to illustrate the problem that we have here okay so this professor that the snakeskin belt Professor he um what was the Battle do you know the belt make was a Gucci or something that's really awesome I don't think he'd tell me he's not my biggest fan um he he wrote a paper where he said that if the European Central Bank didn't do QE European GDP would be like 4.7 low or something like that and I was quite pleased to see him make a firm prediction for once because these guys very rarely make fun predictions and I put my hand up and I said to him do you think that's right and he was like what do you mean and I was like do you think he's right he's like I don't understand the question I was like do you think if that hadn't have happened GDP 4.7 lower he was like I don't know what you mean and this guy he is not analyzing the economy he's writing [ __ ] papers you know he doesn't care if it's right he doesn't even think about whether it's right you know I asked him once why do you think people are not have not been spending money since 2008 and he said I'm not really sure but I think it's because of an exogenous shock to consumption savings preferences and yeah I've asked a lot of people nobody ever told me that was [ __ ] why you know what I mean and I think but maybe they said it in other words which is there was this goal of natural crisis which then changed people's options the more you understand what that means the matter it is because an exogenous shock is a technical term referring to economic modeling it means something happened outside of our model right and I've asked him something about the real world and his answer is something changed outside the model that is [ __ ] insane that is an insane thing to say and a professor should be he should be ashamed to say something like that so what he's saying the global financial crisis was an exogenous shock exactly so you cannot describe things in the real world as exogenous shots that means something outside the model changed well no for instance so like you could say in the early 1970s you have a massive rise in inflation because there is an exogenous shock which is the global oil crisis yeah but you say what the shock is yeah you know you said it happened because of the oil crisis okay something over there changed yeah but you can't just describe a real world change as an exogenous shock in general well something changed on [ __ ] Jupiter on Mars he was just saying long words because he didn't really have a problem the problem is he but the first he's obfuscating his own lack of knowledge but the biggest problem is he thinks that's a legit answer and that is the problem when you have people who these guys who live so much in the models and care so little about the real world that they don't even realize that they're talking about models anymore you you need to be coming to grips with the real world and what is happening in the real world and this is why I get frustrated about the lack of sort of class representation in economics because they can get away with that because they're [ __ ] rich and they don't get hurt you know whereas it's my mates who [ __ ] lose their [ __ ] homes it's interesting I remember having a sort of interaction with an economist recently actually I think it's former formerly at the bank of England I can't remember what it was he was on some subcommittee it wasn't like you know it wasn't a big cheese but it's a relatively sort of esteemed Economist and I think I said some throwaway remark like somebody says something about growth and I said mate this little crap go down a High Street you know I live I live in Portsmouth I go down that I can go down to the Town Center City Center I can tell you all Bournemouth where I'm from yeah we ain't growing and we're not going to see real meaningful economic growth for a long time and he said well that's literally why we have economics so we don't have to like go down the street and see what's going on oh my God but what's crazy is the Bank of England even has methodologies which include survey data going to talk to people and saying how do you feel we have you know survey data about um consumer confidence business investment confidence but like you say like they just think it's the models and like this is reality and the actual living organism out there where we do these transactions in real life that's that's just I forget about it that doesn't matter yeah almost but what's the point if you know I always remember when Russell Brand was getting involved and a lot of my mates were back home right Russell Brand he's from not far where I'm from right when he was and he went on news now and at that time it was E15 moms you remember 15 months a bunch of mums in Stratford who were losing their homes and we're getting kicked out of the area where they where they lived and he'd spoken to them and he went on and he spoke to it was Evan Davis at BBC and I thought he gave quite like a emotional like you know a genuine like police like the plight of these people look what's happened to these people and Evan Davis turned around and showed him a 150-year graph of per capita wage growth 150-year graph right which is and it's an average right it's an average right so that could be dragged up by the super rich right yeah and he showed him this graph and he said well you know yeah I can see what he's saying but look you're wrong I've showed you this 150 graph and it's this that is sickening to me that is sickening to me because here's a guy who's telling you look people from where I'm from are losing their homes and the guys turn around and say well actually I've done the [ __ ] numbers and it's everything's fine and you know he Evan Davis can say that to me because I've got [ __ ] two economics degrees and I can turn around to him and say well that's a [ __ ] average who [ __ ] cares if it's just a bunch of [ __ ] millionaires dragging it up doesn't help my mates doesn't help the E15 mums a [ __ ] comedian you can't show him 150 degrees [ __ ] what's that was it GDP what was it it was what per capita wage growth I think you can find you can go over look at on YouTube but I mean but that stuff also it's like look after you get the Industrial Revolution for the first 40 50 years there isn't actual meaningful improvements and living standards that only happens when you get industrial action strikes revolutions riots because the rolling class realize okay well we can't do this forever and and the thing is Evan Davis will know something like that it's called the angles pause it's named after Frederick Engels interestingly enough we'll go on to the next question Evan Davis was one of the people who uh pioneered the poll tax policy and if you know that I didn't know that yeah he raising in my estimation even yeah he worked he worked in a think tank in the late 80s I can't remember which one it was so I won't say but it's one of these sort of pro pro thatcherite think tanks and and he was one of the the minds behind the poll tax policy which is one of the most unpopular economic policies in the history of this country and now he's just viewed as sort of some Centrist you know clever BBC political economics Finance voice yeah I mean it shows you how extreme those voices really are let's talk about the Tory mini budget yeah um which became this massive news story people who are watching this probably heard look I know what guilts are but I don't talk about them very often yeah yeah they heard lots of words like guilts for the first time just kind of briefly explain what actually happened okay so yeah let's break it down from Basics so the very first thing is they announce um a big package of spending and also tax cuts um the big thing which wasn't expected was they had this cut of the 45p rate which the first thing to say is that rate kicks in at 150 Grand it doesn't affect you if you're 150 Grand because it's only above 150 Grand so really you're only significantly cutting tax on people who earn like 200 300 400 a grand or a million pound a year so it's a big tax cut specifically for very high earners markets weren't expecting that and Traders looked at that and so the next thing to say is you know these were unfunded tax um tax cuts and what that means is the government is planning to borrow that money so you know it means we're getting less money in we're having to spend more money on things like energy we're going to borrow the difference and when you borrow money when the government borrows money it doesn't just come out within it they borrow it from people essentially from rich people and those decisions of whether to lend it or not are made by Traders and the Traders look at the government and they think well you know Kobe's finished now and we're in a more ordinary Economic Times and you're planning to run a massive deficit just to stuff rich people's pockets with cash right and you know if you're going to run massive deficits in normal times you know you don't have to be a genius to be like well how are you going to pay that back then basically and Traders basically thought okay well this is not a coherent plan so probably one of two things will happen you're a student of History you will know that historically when governments have borrowed massive amounts of money the way they've paid it back normally is through inflation so if you have very high inflation prices go up price go up and wages also go up and your tax take Rises significantly the debt stays the same size because it's fixed in nominal terms and then it's easy to pay back that's how the second world award that was paid back so Traders are looking it's thinking well they're not serious about paying it back so maybe they're going to inflate it away not only that but they're given a crap ton of money out so that's going to cause inflation so they start selling the pound because you don't want pounds it's going to be inflation right you know it means basically it means the pound is worth less you can't get as much for it they start selling the pound pound starts falling the bank of England whose job is to keep inflation at two percent look at that and they say Okay number one government's giving a crap ton of money out number two pounds foiling which means our input is going to cost them all the inflation situations looking even worse so people are looking at the bank of England and thinking okay they're gonna rise rates raise rates massively and this is in a context of already even before the budget we're talking about rates going up to five five and a half percent so suddenly they're thinking okay maybe it's going to go up to six and a half seven percent and if you know the bank of England is going to raise rates then you're gonna you're not going to lend to the government unless you can get a similar rate right you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lend the government for zero if I can get four or five percent from the bank of England so suddenly the bank of England but the government bonds also got up to four and a half percent and this creates a panic basically because everybody starts selling the government bonds Pension funds a lot of people's pensions are invested in government bonds they start collapsing and it basically just creates a broad Market panic because Traders are looking at the government and thinking they don't have a plan they don't have a plan like they're not going to pay the debt back are they going to inflate it away the central bank is going to raise the rates people start thinking well if rates go up to five six seven percent what does that mean for mortgages you know I think this is the big question right you know if the bank of England rate goes up your mortgage will go up and you know we all know how big mortgages are especially London but also in the rest of the country and if you can fund that two percent fine but can you fund it at 10 can you find it at eight percent well there's this amazing data isn't there which says basically obviously people love to talk about 1990 15 interest rates but because obviously house prices are so much higher now people have got much larger mortgages actually interest rates at five six percent now would feel like 15 in 1990 yeah and this seems kind of lost on yeah a lot of analysis yeah exactly you know house prices are a lot lot higher now than they were in the 80s and you know you know the reality of the situation is a lot of people you know even people who are not that poor are going to be brought into situations where they can't pay the mortgage you know a lot millions of people you know that's and then you start questioning you know the economy of the whole country you know it's these guys and and the maddest thing of it all is this this situation was created simply so the government gave a tax cut to Millionaires and it's one of the maddest things I've ever seen um and it created this Carnage eventually the bank of England was forced to come in and agree to start lending money to the government again you know there's talk about is this Q is this not QE but the bank of England eventually came in and backstopped the the bonds the government bonds start to lend money to the government um and you know I talk to Traders and they're looking at the government and they're just thinking what are these guys playing it's such a [ __ ] up you know I think a lot of people think oh this was the plan this was not the plan this was not the plan I think they thought they'd get away with it and um yeah they couldn't but you know even now they've basically backed backed away you know the u-turned on it and I predicted they would you turn up a video on Sunday the reason I predicted that U-turn by the way is because I started on the 45p on the 45p top three it's because I started getting texts from people I don't get texts from you know what I I live in these worlds now you know I'm writing a book and I'm in this sort of publishing world you know I'm in the media world now I'm getting techs and people who are not poor saying this policies [ __ ] and it's because they've got mortgages right you know they've got massive mortgages a lot of people are not poor I've got big you know it's not the poorest people have the mortgages because they can't get mortgages right yeah and you know these guys work in the media they were and you know even these guys some of them you know I guarantee you those Tory back benches they are their kids they've got mortgages you know so what the conservative government did here you know yeah I don't need to tell you these guys have been hurting the poor for a long time but suddenly they took this big step to hurt homeowners and you know a lot of people in the media are homeowners or not I I just thought the media is not going to accept this and if the media doesn't you know they need the media to to go with it for it to happen the media wouldn't accept it they're gonna have to back down it eventually did well that's the big difference to austerity isn't it and that's kind of what frustrates me the most with this stuff is that after 2010 to 2015 the bottom 25 of this country were destroyed they were crushed and the middle class the upper middle class like say if your height you can be even Ultra Rich if you're highly leveraged on loans for property you might be a buy select landlord or whatever you're terrified by all of this right and they've got a glimpse of that and within a week like it was just amazing to see how radicalized they became and it's like welcome to reality for the rest of the for the country right yeah but I think this is kind of you know the rich have got unbelievably richer in the last 15 years um and personally I think that the conservative party is basically behind this but there comes to a point where you've cut everything you know the welfare state is cut to a bare minimum enough they cut that back further it's going to be and it looks like they might you're going to see real it's going to be bad right and it's difficult to cut stuff there but then then how do you make the rich richer how do you keep making the rich richer and you know the only assets left are the houses of the middle class now you know so it comes to a point where you know you need to hit those people if you want to make the rich richer anymore you know because the economy is not growing so the only way the rich get richer is taking assets from the rest of us you know we've cut their taxes we've cut you know government services um and now I think the conservatives are in this bind where it's like how do you keep that machine going without hitting your core motorbikes which is homeowners you know and I think they're I think they've really stuck here because you know they the only thing you can do here to prevent an economic collapse is tax the rich and it's like their reason to be that they can't do that so I think that they they tried this thing which is well why don't we if you if you look at it in a sense it's a clever strategy right because it worked in covid give ordinary families a bit and they're rich a lot um but the problem is and I think this is like a great irony and something that people who are on the left such as yourself and myself should ask ourselves the people who stopped that it wasn't us it was financial markets and we need to be sending that message look they are taking your assets and giving it to the rich and they're making you poorer and you know I think this is an opportunity because the conservatives need that wedge to be between the middle and the port yeah they need that witch to be there but at the same time there's nothing left to take from the port so you know we need to convince the Middle look these guys are not going to help you in the long run you know where are your kids going to live how's your kid going to afford a house where your grandkids gonna live yeah you know we and we need to make the explanation look I know they're giving you money but they're giving the rich a ton of more money than they're giving you and that will make you poorer we need to build that understanding what I think is ironic is sort of the riot has sort of built itself on economic credibility and like the empowerment of individual and yet they are destroying the financial lives of all the new families and I think it's a great feeling of us that we haven't managed to explain to ordinary Families how Bleak their future is on this path and that's you know that's what I try through on my YouTube that's like my sort of Mission to explain look and then so I think it's it's where we are now is bad but that creates this opportunity to build this broader Coalition yeah that unites the middle and and poorer people and says look this doesn't work for any of us one of the most frustrating things for me though is people are saying this is the Tories and then when labor come back in you know things will be fantastic some things will obviously be significantly better but like you say our economic model is about generating revenues for a certain group of people they're looking around for sources of wealth what are they NHS and like you say that the housing assets of the middle class in this country and they will gobble them up because that's how it works whoever the government is that's where the pressure will come from housing 2023 since we're talking about it what's going to happen to the housing market you said that you were right when Larry Elliott was wrong about house prices during covert what happens next year so I'm actually quite confident and most people won't agree with me on this that in the medium to long-term house prices will go up and the reason for that is because the government's giving a ton of money out and and that money's ending up with the rich and that will you know ritual buy assets and that will push broadly assets up obviously in the short term we've got massive headwinds which is this massive increase in interest rates so I think in the short term Anything Could Happen um I actually think so I was of the opinion that interest rates would come back down because ordinary families you know the bottom 70 80 are being so squeezed by what's happening that they will not be able to spend and that means inflation will be quite short-lived and that means the rates will come back down but then what I saw was that the government is planning to fix that by running another massive deficit and you know I know you know your history this has happened before right if the government gives out a ton of money that creates inflation and then tries to deal with it by giving out a ton of money that does not bode well for long-term inflation and long-term value of the currency um so I sort of start to think well actually maybe we could enter a bit of a spiral here where inflation stays high and interest rates Stay High but then what happened is the market rejected that so I think it depends on what the government does and unfortunately both outcomes are bad right if the government decides to just churn money out which ends up going ending up with the rich then you will see a big rise in interest rates and a big rise in inflation and that caused this this kind of conflict right because in the long run assets have to go up but people can't get mortgages and I think what that would lead to in the end is basically people who have used mortgages about to sell their houses to the people who have the cash because I mean you and I sit here and you think oh interest rates go up that makes it hard to buy a house a ton of people don't need a mortgage to buy a house nowadays because the really rich are stacking up so much cash and they are the guys who get paid the high rates of interest on this cash um but now it looks more likely and this is very up in the air we don't know what the government's going to do that they're going to move towards a kind of austerity light model and I think that will probably take us if they do that to a more post 2008 situation where it's in miseration for ordinary people inflation will eventually come down because the middle class has their spending power so badly hit and house prices end up going up because the rich have so much money and they need they want assets they want to buy they want to buy things with that money um and I think that think that's the bigger risk because I think people don't realize how much it a lot of people in the middle of society economically don't realize how much it hurts their family especially their kids and their grandkids when house prices go up um I think that is the risk but medium to long term I'm very confident that house prices will go up and and you know that's a very that's a very um anti-consensus View at the moment but the fact is and this is the thing people keep missing and I've missed it since the beginning of covid the rich are stacking up so much cash here and they're not going to sit on it they're going to use the biases and I think I think one thing that will have to happen is the government will end up being forced to relax mortgage requirements because you're doing this right that's right 50 in mortgage products they need to keep people being homeowners but they also want to make the rich richer well how do you do that bigger mortgages then you can own your home technically you own your 800 900 Grand home but you also owe 800 Grand debt to the rich so you you've got the home but they've got the actual wealth so I think that will happen um and I think the way that we fight that is we have to make this connection between the distribution and the quality of life of ordinary people we have to make that connection because if we don't make that people's lives get worse they don't understand why they're like well I've got more money my house price is going up I should be richer but if if you are getting relatively poorer then you you'll get less stuff you know we've had in the last three years the biggest and fastest ever increasing inequality in the country and the biggest and fastest decrease in living standards in in peace time and no one's connecting the two and I think it's such an opportunity that we're missing we need to say look you are getting poorer because of that increasing inequalities it's not it's not a complicated connection you know you increase inequality you improve their living standards you decrease yours I'm kind of surprised actually the middle class aren't more angry about it like the people that shop shop at waitrose very affluent looking to retire in a couple of years there's many many people like that who are very very I'm not saying they all vote labor or Tory or lib Dem they do all three or they don't vote at all but they know that they're really [ __ ] their kids and their grandkids they know that that's the connection we need to make but but they know that don't they I mean that's because there's polling out there for instance about should house prices fall yeah it's really interesting yeah yeah and actually over 50 of the public say it would be in the public interest for house prices too full that doesn't mean they want house prices to fall because it's not necessarily in their rational self-interest but they know what needs to happen yeah there must be there's a lot of guilt out there surely amongst those people you know there's this article which always appears in the newspapers which is how I bought a house by saving up and stop buying coffees and famously it always has like in there and then I got 300 grand for my mum like hidden in there those articles in my opinion are to assuage the concerns of older Property Owners because older Property Owners which is massively the voting base of the conservative party have been to a large degree protected you know so you know my parents have always been poor but they own their own property and that means that very likely they'll be able to live to some degree comfortably until their retirement they'll probably have to just save that property right and they'll lose the home but they've been protected even though they've been poor their whole lives right but if they were to look more broadly to look at their kids and say oh well you know how are my kids going to be they'd be like they'd have to look realistically and be like [ __ ] that's what they earn that's the house prices what's their pension what's their retirement look like how do I have elderly people don't want to think about that and then if the media tells you well listen don't worry you know what kids are like they're a bit silly they waste their money they'll sort out they'll stop buying the coffees they'll stop buying that stuff and they'll be okay those articles are there to tell and you know it's it's easy to convince someone something they want to believe right you know those guys go out there and sell to older people that we you're protected and we know it might look bad for your kids but don't worry we've got that they don't have that and we need to counter that missing and it's not easy because our message is in some ways unpalatable which is if we stay on this path your kids and your grandkids will have very very difficult economic lives but we need to make that case and you know those are the people in a sense that we need to win and you know it's their kids and their grandkids being hurt and we need to find a way to communicate to them clearly and compassionately so they don't feel attacked look we are trying to protect your kids and your grandkids we're not attacking you you know where are your kids going to live what is their life going to be like are your kids going to be able to afford to have kids of their own you know that is the message that I think we need to be making if there's a young person watching this and they're thinking I really want to get on the housing ladder yeah um and then there's loads of calculations that play right do I need to maybe move um what should I prioritize etc etc presumably you would still it's not often on Navara media we talk about financial advice but presumably you would therefore say it and given what you said five minutes ago about you think house price will continue to go up but they should do that I've been saying this you know consistently if you could don't wait for the market to go down if you can do it get on the ladder if you can if you can listen if you don't have property that's not a flat position your short one property because you've got to live somewhere you know the first thing you should be looking to do and and I totally understand that in today's economy that means taking 300 400 if you're in London 600 700 Grand of debt maybe and that is risky and that is unappealing and I wish that we were not in that situation but the truth is if you don't own a property you are in very precarious financial position and the best way you can get yourself out of that is to get yourself a property and you know I wish that didn't mean taking a massive massive mortgage and I can't pretend to people that you're not taking a massive Financial Risk of buying a property but the truth is you are also taking a massive Financial Risk and not buying a property because look what's happening to rent look what's happening to house prices you know there's people in London now they don't even know where they're going to live you know and you know if you don't have a property you're a short one property you need to get that just to make yourself secure and and I have to say when I say that that I know I know full world that that is advice that is impossible for a lot of people and I understand that of course um but that is you know I have to tell people the honest truth um and and if you are in a situation where you can't then you know support me follow my Channel people like you so we can come out and explain look that it could be possible if we change things I mean I'll I'll provide an example here so I left I left London because I'm with my now wife because we wanted to have children and we knew that we had to own somewhere to do that because we we couldn't we'd love to rent if you had five year ten years you didn't have a massive increase Etc and kind of sort of security around housing that you say maybe have in Germany we don't have that here so we knew that we had to buy it somewhere that meant we had to move out of London we did buy somewhere on the south coast and doing that just just open my eyes so much as the J it's even worse than you think if you're renting how rigged the system is the minute we we access the mortgage we didn't pay any um stamp Duty that went uh we then that house in two years has gained more in value than I've earned working we actually bought in a really good moment right at the beginning of the covert crisis where lots of like I say sort of student property developers just wanted to get rid of their assets right yeah and I just feel like and then as we're remortgaging fortunately we remortgages for all this happened yeah you've got people saying yeah you can you can borrow against the increase in the value of the house and you think this is nuts and yet there are tens of millions of people in this country who think it's not normal not acceptable they're virtuous and it's like you keep on being rewarded for being lucky and then you get rewarded again and rewarded again the people who actually down on the luck because they couldn't get the initial cash capital for Deposit they keep on being punished and I just feel like how do we get that I know I know renters know they're in a bad situation but it's like it's so much worse than you even realize yeah I mean it's you know I I you know my channel is it's mainly about all economics and politics but we do do sort of we talk about investing we talk about buying property and um it's hard because I get so many messages like you know what can I do to make money and the truth is like you know in the last few years we've seen this big increase in sort of crypto and online trading and um it sells the stream you can sort of invest away to wealth but the truth is you know like I I live off of my assets you know I'm a wealthy Division I live off of my assets you know if you come if you come to me with like 500 Grand then and you can if you make five percent a year you can make 25 Grand you can live off that if you come to me with 10 15 grand you make five percent a year you know you're not even going to make 100 pounds you know so it's sort of this is and the thing is I want to tell people this buy a property if you can because it's a good Financial advice but I just know it's impossible and then that's why I think what's really interesting you look at the journey that Martin Lewis has been on Martin Lewis money saving expert I guess people know here's this guy that's like protect your interests do what's good for you change your mortgage provider change your electricity provider and now he's coming out with you have to fight the government because because the problem is they the rich have all the money in all the assets you are not going to beat them in that game the only Power you have the only Power you have is that there's more of you and if you try and use that by trading crypto you don't use that power it's like it's like the Kung Fu movies where 100 guys fight Bruce Lee one at a time you know we need to explain to people that being political is the best way to protect your financial interest as an individual as a family as a community because it genuinely is I genuinely believe that and if you don't do that you know this thing recently where we suddenly saw you know a lot of like nice well-off people messaging me oh my mortgage rate's going to go up and then the government backs down that is what happened when when you act politically as a community you force government to change and I also understand that a lot of people are struggling financially and they struggle to have the energy to act politically and you know if you don't have anything to give don't give anything but if you if you have a little bit of space a little bit of energy you need to engage with this because you are under attack your houses are under attack your living stands are under attack and the only way to push back is to be political and and you know I come from poor background and people I don't want to be political but the truth is this is what happens if you're not political you know there's a fight going on if you don't fight it you lose hmm yeah going back to that thing about um renting and Home Ownership yeah because of course if you say well we need and I believe this we need house prices to go down at least 10 15 and then stagnate basically for 20 years and then somebody would say well that means that somebody who's just bought a property here and there might be a young viewer of yours living in I don't know Leicester right and they just bought a nice terraced house nothing special 230 Grand and they're going to go into negative equity okay they go into negative equity let's say for 18 months I'd still rather be in their shoes paying towards an asset which at least in the medium to long term is going to be making cash then renting I don't I I don't understand how people think the negative Spectrum people you say negative equity and people go oh my God they start panicking and say renting is much worse than negative equity I was renting in London for 15 years I lost about 85 Grand renting I've got nothing to show for it yeah and yet in the popular imagination somehow negative equity is like way worse than renting yeah I think what I say the problem actually is the house price to wage ratio if you think about it that's the problem you know it's it's that's not massively you know 20 years ago 30 years ago that was like three or four and now it's like in London 2030 or more so what you really want you can fix the problem without house prices coming down if you allow wages to arise and I think what's interesting is in the last 20 30 years so we have the bank of England who have this mandate to keep inflation down except housing inflation exactly it doesn't look at house prices that inflation does not include house prices so we have a mechanism that allows house prices to go up but does not allow wages to go up and because people want to avoid negative equity we do not allow house prices to come down so we've created an unfixable problem if you let our house prices to go up and you simultaneously will not accept falling house prices or Rising wages then that problem is unfixable and I think we need to accept that we have a problem here and we need to we need to look realistically why is this so big and how do we bring wages up in my opinion the reason that this Market has become so big is because the rich are so [ __ ] rich now and these guys buy assets it's not just houses that have gone up land prices gone up stocks have gone up luxury cars have gone up luxury art has gone up gold has gone up every single asset has rocketed in price because the rich are unbelievably rich people need to understand ultimately there is a competition here for who owns the assets and if you allow the rich to be unbelievably Rich think about it like this right imagine you are Elon Musk is a billionaire whatever right imagine you've got 100 million quid imagine that you're at your net worth 100 million quid you will make on that wealth about 5 million pounds a year let's say four you make four million pounds a year just for getting out of bed how much do you spend per day per year I could live on 15 grand here easily well you're making four million pounds a year yes honestly I mean as being a Schleich 30 grand a year 40 Grand a year it's a sensible person would would spend 200 300 Grand a year live a life of luxury yeah and use the other 3.7 million pounds to buy more assets that's what they do and it's it's not that they're evil I don't hate these people they're not bad people it's just if you're super rich you have a massive income and it happens automatically you just put it in the stock that's the incentives yeah you know and that so you create this vacuum of wealth that sucks whilst out of ordinary family so of course house prices are going to rise because they have got so much money they're going to push it up let me ask you a question that actually relating to this because at Labor Party Conference Kirsten ratliner policy and he said he wanted homeownership to go from 65 to 70 it was 70 in 2003 so yeah important to say we've gone backwards right and that they would do this basically through some government-led mortgage scheme presumably they will provide deposits to people I don't know how they would do it they could be subprime mortgages presumably which are backed by the state I have no idea that to me sounds like oh you're only going to further inflate the mortgage Market though because of course going from 65 to 70 again means you've got a massive increase in demand good I'm happy to do that but that doesn't sound like a solution to me if you're saying we're going to help home ownership by increasing prices and again they're going to outship wage increases I think this is what this is what happens when you when you don't deal with the fundamental problem that inequality is increasing massively you know how do you keep people in homes when inequality is increasing massively you know if you have this constant flow of wealth and assets from ordinary families to the rich then how would you keep them in their homes the only way to do it because homes are ultimately the largest form of wealth in the country the only way to do is have massive increase in debt and this is if you start looking for sort of technocratic solutions this is what will happen you just end up putting people into more and more debt and I think that is what will happen and we need people need to understand that you cannot be rich without assets and the current setup sees an enormous flow of assets and wealth and money every year from ordinary families to the rich you know you make 30 grand you spend all of that on mortgage rent food bills energy that money doesn't disappear it goes to the owner of your house the owner of your mortgage the owner of the food the owner of Tesco the owner of the energy companies right you earn 30 grand you give all of it to the rich and it is that guy Rishi sunak is worth 700 million pounds right you know he will make every year two he'll make 20 million pounds on that every single year and that that's where your mortgage payment goes you know so if you create a system where there's this enormous flow of money wealth assets from ordinary families to the rich then year after year generation after generation ordinary families will get poorer and this fundamentally needs to be fixed until we grasp this problem life will get worse and worse that is exactly why I do the job that I do I don't need to do this you know what I mean I've made a lot of money and I could keep making more money I could go live on a beach in the Philippines but poverty will explode if we don't deal with this let's talk about deficits it's a word that's not mentioned anymore it was very it was very common between 2010 and 2015. um the Tories promised to eliminate the deficit by 2015 when they came into government with the liberal Democrats in 2010. we've been running a deficit since 2010 actually it's important to say we've been running virtually permanent deficits since the late 1970s for the tour is quote unquote balancing the books there's always this this big watch word are they ever going to balance the books which is to say are they ever going to preside over a situation where actually they bring in more through General taxation yeah than they spend through public spending because they promised to do that for years it never happens I think it will probably never happen Okay so you know lots of people have lots of strong opinions on this governments don't need to run surpluses you can run a deficit the reason is because deficits get eroded over time by both economic growth and by inflation so your your debt is fixed in nominal terms inflation pushes the prices up so if you have growth of nowadays you don't get much but if you get one two percent if you have inflation of two three percent then your deficit is naturally falling related to the size of your economy by four or five percent every year so you can afford to run a four or five percent deficit over time you can if that's what you want and it's it's I'm not opposed to deficits at all um I think the last years I've seen some people sort of push this direction of let's run massive deficits and I think the deficit in code was necessary I think the big problem that this sort of people saying let's run massive deficits is it totally defends people like me saying let's tax the rich because if you turn around to me and say there's no problem with deficits even massive ones why tax the rich we just run a massive deficit and then what you do is you politically enable things like covid we're a massive crisis led to a 600 billion pound World transfer to the rich so actually using the mmt people the modern monetary Theory people they've got it completely wrong they're providing the sort of intellectual foundations if they're saying and not all of them do say that we need to run massive deficits don't worry about class struggle don't worry about inequality yeah actually what they're doing is providing a license to yeah you know what the transfer of wealth from world to Rich I don't want to mischaracterize them because it's a big community and different people believe different things and I think the sort of you know the the high Priests of it the people who sort of really into it often they will say well actually mmt does support taxation of the rich the problem is the message that has cut through is definitely so not dangerous and the message that you need to tax the rich has not cut through because I I talk about taxing language all the time and I free frequently get people posting against me you don't need to tax the rich you understand money okay so there's no doubt about it the mmt has persuaded a lot of people you don't need to tax the rich and I think you know and people disagree with this but I think if you just print money and that money ends up with the rich you will increase inequality and and you will decrease living standards you know distribution matters it matters of course it does you can't massively increase inequality and not expect living standards to fall and the last three years have shown exactly that happening so I think I'm not against deficits that you know and of course I'm not pro austerity a government can afford to run a deficit but if you take your eye off of inequality and you say deficits are totally fine we don't really care about what that does to inequality you can't be surprised when the Tory government turns around and say okay well we're going to tax ordinary people's taxes we're going to cut ordinary people's taxes by 100 quid and the richest taxes by 50 Grand you've allowed that right you've allowed that because you've said to them we're not going to fight you in running deficits and we're not going to fight you on inequality so they're going to run a deficit to increase inequality so I think we deficits can be a tool in a certain time of course the power is not unlimited of course the power is not unlimited but if you take it off the ball with inequality and with distribution it will rise you need to watch it so you're talking about taxing the rich but we're often told that imposing higher taxes on profits higher incomes would drive business away from the UK what would your response to that be so the first thing is I'm not talking about tax incomes more I'm talking about taxing wealth more you can tax income less if you want you know what I mean and then you can attract higher earners here if you want but when we talk about driving people away I think the one single only good thing to come out of this war in Ukraine is that the government turned around and suddenly decided they wanted to tax rich people at a very specific subset of rich people which is Russian billionaires and uh Roman Abramovich who of course owns Chelsea Football Club he [ __ ] paid it because you cannot put Chelsea Football Club in a bag you know I think that idea rests on a perception of rich people as if they are guys with like a massive bag of cash okay rich people are rich because they own your houses they own your house they own your mortgage their own [ __ ] Tesco's down the road they own the skyscrapers they own the [ __ ] windmills they own the oil rigs they own the [ __ ] land that makes the food they are rich because they own real assets in this they they're rich because they own this country and they can leave if they want the country will still be here and we can tax the assets where the assets are which is here you know what I mean you know Jeff Bezos owns Amazon but Amazon sells to the UK to the US to Europe to Japan you know what I mean you know these guys can't just all move to the Cayman Islands the assets are in the world you know they own real things and we can tax those real things you know ultimately it's a question of do you want your country to be owned by people who pay tax or people who don't you know and it's they can leave the stuff is here they own your mortgage what they're going to do you you know we can tax that payment when you make it ultimately their money comes from you their money comes from when you when you go to the supermarket when you work when you pay your bills when you pay your mortgage when you pay your rent I think people need to there's one video on my channel called what is world and I'm gonna just plug it because it's to explain these guys are rich because they own assets they own this country of course we can tax it and I think nothing shows that better than Roman Abramovich turning around trying to sell Chelsea Football Club to anyone who's going to buy it because it's there it exists and we can tax it why do you think quasi quaten got rid of their cap on Bankers bonuses because presumably the same argument there right actually it's a little bit different because that's not a tax it wasn't actually raising money they might actually make the argument it'll raise more money because we'll have a larger financial service industry here what was that what was the thinking that you think I'll be honest the the thing I understood the economics of the budget very well in my opinion the thing which I'm struggling to understand is why they did what they did and the most people I speak to are struggling as well um and you know some people say they're ideological I'll be honest a lot of people say that they're idiots a lot of people in the markets genuinely think they're idiots quiz equaling worked in markets and everybody's saying I know this guy that worked with him he said he was an absolute idiot he's got PhD in economic history um I couldn't tell you honestly I think that he probably thinks that it will do you think he thinks it'll play well with a certain demographic he's trying to pitch himself as we are pro-growth and we are pro dynamism yeah one thing I'd say that I think is interesting about bank because I was a banker for a long time I was very poor growing up right that is the kind of policy which you ask 15 year old me doing maths lying on the floor of his front room you know what I mean he'll probably like it you know what I mean because I'm poor and I see a system where you know people around me in London are millionaires and don't pay much tax and I'm thinking well I want to get out that channel you know Finance is aspirational isn't it for people for me it was aspirational you know what I mean so I couldn't tell you for sure and I think it's I mean it's Fallen flat um but I think maybe he's trying to pitch himself as aspirational like that seems to be what they're going for as a brand would it play well with the sort of people you used to work with would they sort of hear that come through in the mini budget statement yeah at Citibank and go [ __ ] you know I've got a good story about this um so I started work in 2008 and in 2009 um I think it was in 2009 it was still a labor government and they were they announced a big increase in tax on the banks right um and I was [ __ ] myself right because I was still poor I'd never been paid you know you know I had a job at a bank but I don't need any money yet and I was like [ __ ] me I work this hard to get here and now they're going to raise taxes on me and I looked around me at the Traders on the desk they were [ __ ] laughing they were [ __ ] laughing because they knew it wouldn't affect them they knew it wasn't affected and I remember this sort of it's weird for someone like me who comes from a poor background to just see this confidence dislike and that was a labor government right this knowledge that look these got and these guys don't worry we got them don't go Nick they're going to come for us it's just it's just it's for the people you know it's it's you know and you know the bank of bonus cap in the reality of it is all it led to was a massive increase in Banker salaries you know so it's a good example of attacks which is for for your image basically it's a messaging tax because it you know essentially it's not tax it's just a change in the structure of pay you know um so I honestly think they probably don't really care they they understand that it's just it's for messaging it's a it's for the conservative part in the way they look on the crypto thing we mentioned it a bit earlier on so tons of working class guys and others as well but it is a thing as far as I can see have sort of been sucked into crypto yeah um are they being conned you know you're somebody that's interested in financial markets and assets and wealth but the way it's being talked about and speculated on particularly on social media it seems a little bit more like a Ponzi scheme am I being unfair basically in my opinion yes listen I live on my investments I I make investments I'm I'm an investor if you want to invest in something you should do your due diligence okay the number one thing that you should check before anything else you probably should need to check it is that the thing that you're buying [ __ ] exists you know these guys it's [ __ ] internet points mate see I yeah I'm gonna get hate on this for the internet that is what it is it's internet points you know and I said this before this crash I've been saying it for a long time these guys are selling your [ __ ] snake oil you know and they're going to take that money that you gave to them to buy your their [ __ ] dog coin and they're gonna buy your [ __ ] mom's house that is what they're gonna buy with it you know you could be saving that money to buy houses and they're selling you [ __ ] points on the internet and and I understand it I understand it you know because I've been there I've been poor you see the guys are making money trading blah blah blah and you know all the guys who you know they're showing on their Instagram I bought a Lamborghini with crypto listen I've come out on crypto so I get the messages from people all right the guys who [ __ ] lost their [ __ ] life savings trading crypto they don't [ __ ] post on Instagram you know it's as simple as that but they message me they message me saying I've lost all my money can you give me some advice I've got this new strategy and I have to message them back saying listen you've got a problem it's an addiction my advice is that you never trade this ever again and you know and you come out and you you once you speak out on it you get these guys flooding to you oh I've lost all my [ __ ] savings and it's you know it's [ __ ] gambling addiction and it ruins it ruins lives of his family and you know also you know these people I've been poor I've been that [ __ ] young dumb full of [ __ ] guy that wants to make a ton of cash you know what I mean I understand it but these people they should be our best fighters to make this [ __ ] system better for ordinary families the guys buying crypto yeah because they're young they've got energy listen I'm getting older now you know what I mean I can't be out every day like pushing this you know but these guys they're getting screwed over by the system and then they're getting sold the [ __ ] fake Cure by the system that's taking all their money come here and help us build a system that will get you a [ __ ] house you know what I mean and and I know it's a seductive idea like you buy this coin you can become a millionaire and you know I'm not telling you if you follow my [ __ ] YouTube You'll Be A Millionaire that's not going to work like that but if we lose this fight you and your family will be [ __ ] I'm sorry I don't want to say like that but that is what it is you know this is not a fight where the winners make millions this is a fight for survival you know so you you would put crypto as a very discreet asset sort of class which is nothing like like you said housing or land or gold you wouldn't touch it with a barge pole I'm sure the reason I'm sure people probably say always sending [ __ ] because he's short the reason I'm sure is because I started to get asked to do a lot of interviews on crypto and I went on TV and radio and said I think it's [ __ ] and you know I'm a big believer that you shouldn't say [ __ ] you don't believe okay so if I'm gonna say something on the radio I've got my nuts on it okay I still trade every day right and the things that I say is going to happen I'm betting on them so I went I opened up and I went short crypto you know I went short crypto just just simply because to explain what that means it means I basically bet the price will go down and if the price goes down I made money and I've made some money on it going down and I'm still short because I think it will still go down um I don't consider myself to be a crypto Trader I'm just saying that because you know opinions are cheap okay I've got my nuts on this if it goes up I'm going to lose money so you know what I believe that's what I believe and you know I was one of the top Traders in the world and I'm a very successful Trader people don't have to believe me but that isn't for me that's a statement of intent and look I don't want to trade crypto I think it's [ __ ] and I think it takes away I think it's sucking the life out of a lot of talented young people and I've seen a lot of things do that in my time um and it's turning them into gambling addicts and I'm being very harsh in it here and I know people are going to come at me but I'm trying to save you money but seriously you know I'm just telling you what I believe you don't have to agree with me but look you know we're losing our houses here are you trading dog coins like you're going to play with us or you're going to play with that that's the way I see it last question you recently said my grand macro thesis Is that real interest rates have to stay low as we've said and that's because the rich of all the wealth and like saving as you've said now no matter how hard you work how smart you are if you come from quote the wrong family you'll probably never own property that is feudalism we're going back into a world of aristocracy capitalism's over so capitalism is over what does that mean it's a good quote first of all it's a great quote that's what we're ending on it um when I say capitalism is over I say capitalism is a big word people have different ideas what it means okay but for me and for what I think a lot of people from where I'm from believe capitalism is or should be is a system where if you [ __ ] work hard and you're talented and you go for it and you do your best and you get the good degree and you get the good job and you hit it you should not necessarily become super rich but you should have there for you a nice secure comfortable Life House family if you want it that's capitalism that is the way I know some people not agree with that but that is the way people where I'm from are raised to believe it's about a society where if you work hard if you do the right thing you will be sure yeah that is that is what we we are like raised to believe that we live in that kind of society and I live in a world now well look I've got a mate he's a big fan of yours by the way so be happy to be mentioned he works in fashion smart guy went to Central Martin's big fashion School Works [ __ ] hard you know he lives good money now it took him a long time to get there he lives with his parents saves up saves up saves up because he wants to buy a house but the [ __ ] house prices come up quicker than his [ __ ] his [ __ ] deposit does and now mortgage has gone up how's this guy going to get a house this guy's done [ __ ] everything you want him to do you know what I mean studied hard best university really gone for it worked worked worked saving up everything this guy doesn't even know if he's ever going to be able to afford a family so from and at the same time I've Got Friends buying houses because their mom gave him 400 Grand that's not [ __ ] capitalism that is an inherited Society we are moving away you know there was 30 40 50 60 years where you know my dad worked for the Post Office you know I grew up it's all pakistanis and Indians where I grew up right their grandparents came over from Pakistan from India from Kenya right just worked in shops you know some of them are cleaners and they've got properties now you know what I mean they're secure now that was possible in the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s and it is not possible anymore we've got smart bright hard-working kids going to the best universities doing everything they can and they will never own property so when I say capitalism is over that is what I mean because we have ended a society where Ordinary People can expect a good quality of life for working hard Gary what a pleasure mate thank you cheers I look at economic analysis in the media that is not analysis that is an entertainment product if you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right and punishing them for being wrong then they are not analyzing their [ __ ] dancing [Music] everybody knows the inequality is getting worse well almost everybody anybody serious anyway for Gary Stevenson that is the essential Trend not just the last 15 years the next 15 years too not that long ago Gary was one of the most successful Traders on the planet now he's a campaigner around inequality though he still does the occasional trade as well Gary it's great to have you joining us on Downstream thank you we've got a lot to talk about um we'll start right from the beginning age 22 in 2008 you got a job as a Trader at Citigroup and Carrie Wharf within two years you made your first million pounds and that's a position that a lot of young people aspire to but you started from a very humble beginnings so can you walk us through your story where you come from the the Gary Stevenson kind of narrative Arc yeah okay so I'm from ilford which is a small suburb of East London uh yeah I come from a pretty poor background um little Terrace house next to the railway got uh one brother one sister um I was always very good at math growing up um so I think if you grew up in East London you know when I was a kid we could literally see the the skyscrapers in Canary Wharf going up we were kids um you kind of assume she's going to go into banking right so that was sort of the path I thought I'd go on um I got expelled from school when I was 16 for uh I normally call it a drug related incident um uh what was it it was a cannabis yeah you know you're expelled yeah yeah 16 just for smoking cannabis uh I think I sold about two pounds worth of candy okay yeah which I wouldn't call it a sale but um yeah I was young and I don't condone such things but um it happened back then so I was sort of stuck at home give me a bit of a kick up the ass and also studied for my exams but I did one of my exams and uh you know managed to get good at levels and went to go to lse so let's see I don't know if you know people Melody it's a bit of a London School of Economics it's a bit of a Investment Banking boot camp um and I kind of figured I'd just go there kill the exams I'll study maths in economics and get a job as a Trader uh but that is super hard well exactly what makes you get the job no Maths for a degree yeah is because I know people that did maths at the NSC and they were really good math students at a level or whatever yeah but University level math is incredibly demanding I mean you must be really good at maths maths is it was my thing as a kid yeah yeah I won a few competitions nothing's my thing as a kid um it's just sort of the way my mind works um but I thought I could just go and just kill the mass exams and get a job um but I remember sort of coming back second year and suddenly everyone at lse is just they start talking in acronyms cds's M A's mbos you know cdos IBD and I was thinking what is going on I didn't know anything and I spoke to a friend and he was like yeah you have to apply for 35 internships and you have to you hope you get one and then that's how you get a job and um all of these guys you know lse lse is like literally full of like kids of like Russian oligarchs and the Chinese pilot Bureau you know it's like International billionaires and the Crystal and it'll be like prepping from when they were kids that all like they'd all like started a charity you know and checked through the Sahara Desert and how long did it take you to work this out of the LSC how long did it take you to work out okay the people I'm now studying with at University it's not like the creme de La Creme of the kids at school which was what you think it is before you go to university but it's actually people I've never met before I remember I was in the math department which is a bit of sort of you know what Mass guys I like and we went online sort of away day like very early on and I brought like a two liter bottle of like white lightning Cider on the coach and I was like put some sides it almost look at me like I was insane and I remember thinking this is not like what I saw in the movies um but I was to be honest when I was a kid I was like man on a mission I'm going to get this job nothing's going to stop me and that's why it was quite dispiriting to realize that basically you have to send all these series and cover letters and everyone you've got to fluff it with all this stuff right like I played clarinet at the Royal Albert Hall you know what I mean this kind of stuff and literally I was fluffing pillows at DFS that's all I had you know I tried to be a Grime rapper you know you can't put that on your CV you know I had a little jacket with cadaverous crew written on the back of it but like so I was thinking how am I going to get this job basically and I I didn't know what to do so I just figured like I didn't make a single application because I knew I would never beat these guys on CV and cover letter like there's nothing literally I'm fluffing fluffing pillows the DFS in Vector you know I'm not going to get a job with that so I figured I'll just like try and kill these exams and like be very sort of like loud about it and hope somebody notices and basically somebody did notice because a guy from new above said just I never even met the guy came out to me in the library one day and he said Citibank Cars one Trader you through a card game it's a math game you win that game you can get a job and I was sort of my ears picked up because it's like maths I'm good at maths I'm good at games so let's just do this right and explain like the rules of the game to me and then I went to the competition I won the LSC round and then I basically just stopped going lectures and I just all I did was study this one game which was like a stupid little math game what was the game it's like a card game it's like a poker Style game they make basically like everyone has a card and there's another three cards in the middle and you just you essentially you make bets using a trading style mechanism of what the sum total of everyone's cards will be so it's probabilities basically well this is actually interesting you say that because the the way I won the game was I knew that all the Majesty guys would just calculate the statistical expected value yeah which meant that if someone had a higher card they'd quote higher prices and if someone had a low card they'd quote low prices and you could just buy sell Buy sell buy sell and it's kind of it's amazing it was that easy and and other people probably should have realized what I was doing but I think this is I think another thing which has sort of benefited me throughout my career because of the way that I look in the way that I sound I think people just thought I was [ __ ] an idiot basically doing Mad stuff like but it was easy they were playing the numbers and I was playing the game basically so um I won that competition and The Madness of it is what that meant was you know all these other guys who'd be like learning all these acronyms you know and sort of talking to like you know they were in the investment Society in the finance site going to all these events and here's me turning up on my internship I didn't know anything I didn't know a single acronym I didn't know anything like that um and the maddest thing of it all is the Traders [ __ ] loved it they loved me turning up like some kid from down the road like just like I don't know anything but teach me and I'll do it you know what I mean and um I think it kind of you know there's this myth of like the Cockney wide boy trailer um but I don't exist the Barrow boy exactly yeah you go there nowadays and it's all just um you know it's Rich guys from Rich families is that so it's the same sort of international money the league that goes to lse you know what I mean it's you know there's some sort of Blue Blue Bloods and oxfords and cambridges but it's you know the Coney and MIT and it's all these just Rich guys from Rich family so I think they saw me turn up just like only just for viewers as a university Milan and a finance University man it's like the Italian lse essentially yeah um yeah so they loved it and I turned up and um then the financial crisis happened just after I started and then within a few years I was the most profitable Trader in the bank which um which I guess we'll talk about had happened the City Bank yeah City Bank yeah so so you you start this great job off the back of winning a card game yeah an amazing story and it's like I'm expecting a Netflix film about this yeah it will come yeah I suspect so you go to work at Citibank you walk in first day what's that like trading feels a big place um I remember I remember getting the train to Canary Wharf and the Jubilee line makes this sort of like whooping sound it's not like the trains that go past my window um yeah remember they walked me in I remember just seeing like massive massive floor I think the big thing that hits you about the trade the floor is all these screens it's like every trade has like a wall of like nine screens massive Water Screens like that and um they walked me around and they sort of sat me down um introduced me to the to the boss of the desk and um the boss is high and then he just ignores you right and you sort of you're sitting there nobody says anything because this is the thing that a very common experience when you start on trading draws is everyone says hi and then they just totally ignore you and it's kind of your job to like get seen basically and then you sort of start poking around like can I eat your coffee can I get your tea um can I go get your lunch and that sort of that's like weirdly like I think I sort of just started just getting everyone's lunch for them yeah and I remember this one interview but you're an interest rate Trader well I mean at first I was just an intern right so you're just an intern so you've got no specific you're just an intern you need to get them to hire you to the desk basically right and I remember I just used to try and get everybody lunch I remember sort of one of my first on my one of my first days I got a load of people lunch and I took a little note of like how much everybody's lunch cost and then I put the the change on the table exact exact change next to the trader who paid for the lunches and the trader just he just looked at it you know like when somebody dropped some coins and people just look he looked at the money and he was like what's that and I was like it's a change and he was like it just didn't say anything I was like uh it's like four pound Thirty One and just slid it across the desk into his little drawer and he looked at me right in the face and he said on this desk we keep the change like that like and I was thinking these guys are [ __ ] mad basically um but that works basically and then you know I started getting you know I've got a lot of lunches um eventually they sent me to get like lunch for everyone on the floor I think no it was it was this kind of game dynamic because they knew that I wasn't from that space and they kind of loved it and they were like played little games with me so like on the end of my internship they sent me to buy burgers for everyone the whole trading floor which is like [ __ ] 500 people or something right just call me over Gary all right today I'm buying lunch everyone on the floor and I knew they wanted me to be like [ __ ] myself I was like yeah fine so I did it you know I had to like get everyone involved and then when I came back I sat down after delivering Burgers they were on the floor and they called me Gary Gary you got a passport and I was like yeah so go home and get it you're going skiing and that was like honestly the funniest thing about that was I didn't even realize when you went skiing that you were in mountains you went to the top of the mountains and I was like [ __ ] you know it was mad I remember texting my dad where's my passport on the train so what did you think you were going like cross-country skiing or something I just I only knew like Milton Keynes no scent is the only thing I could think of I just thought it was like on a field or something yeah where I'm from you don't people don't go skiing you know what I mean I didn't know about that um but then that was how I got the job and then 2008 I'll start full time that was when I became like a full-time Trader and then as soon as I hit that desk the crisis happened and that was sort of so when do you start because obviously it's to the best of my recollection now it's basically August September things really hot up in 2008 that's like June 30th 2008. so it's just a couple of months before things go bang yeah yeah basically and um I had no idea what was going on but the the crazy thing was that this guy worked on which was short-term interest rates which is basically short-term loans was a very unfashionable desk previous they literally made loans of like one day which is like not a massively profitable business right um and in the credit crisis 2008 it blew up it became unbelievably profitable so like they had it really attracted all these sort of new school like Yale Harvard types you know with all of these like Immaculate like shirts with a little monogram on it it was all sort of old school Traders and they suddenly they were making a ton of money and um I was just thinking how do I get me some of this money basically how do I follow these guys um and just desperately trying to get them to tell me what are you doing how are you making this money you're like what's happening I was trying to figure it out um and uh it turned out so a lot of what they were doing was basically it was an American bank and they were lending out loads and loads of dollars and it was super profitable because everybody needed dollars and the Citibank at this point is the biggest bank in the world yeah at that point yeah yeah so they were lending a ton of dollars and I remember sort of I figured out what they were doing I learned to 10 dollars too and then I was there was one guy who I worked with who was like it was a scout so he was from Liverpool he didn't go to university and after I put my first big trade on I went home and I thought oh [ __ ] what if this trade goes wrong so I went in next morning I spoke to this guy this scouse guy and he said um I said what's the risk in this trade and he said to me this trade will lose money if the global banking system blows up in which case you'll lose your job and I'll lose my job and it'll be the end of [ __ ] everything but that's not going to happen so we're going to make a ton of money so you just cross your fingers and I hope it works out um so the first couple years all I did was that basically just lend these dollars and that was super profitable in 2008 2009. then in 2010 that stopped being profitable I remember this weird thing happened the Swiss National Bank did something that [ __ ] me and I lost like eight million dollars in a week and that's when I realized like it's not really free money like that and I have to start figuring out like a smarter way to make money so your first year 2008 you make 400 000 pounds be clear for yourself personally something like that now oh no that was that was so 2000 I started in June 2008 yeah um to 2009 my boss who fought who hired me quit basically in the middle of the year and um how come hey I think you made so much money in 2008 that like he just thought I'm going to quit I'm going to like live the dream I'm gonna like build my house in California and that's a whole other story which we can get into but um he quit and uh he said to me you can ask me anything you want and I said what do I need to do to make a hundred grand for the bank at that age so I would have been 20 just turned 22 100 Grand in my mind was like the most money you could make like in a year basically 100 bonus because it's not possible you need to make 10 million dollars for the bank he said I said all right I went back put one massive bet on 12 million dollars one of the year and then yeah and I was expected to get paid a bonus of like 100 Grand and I remember going to the meeting room and it was like just under 400 Grand on the piece of paper and I remember looking and just being like I remember like it was yesterday's my boss was a massive guy and I pointed at the number and I thought it must be another number I pointed the number and I said is it that and he said yeah and I literally said well that's a lot of money how old are you just turn 23. um and I think what is weird about that you know there'll be people who hear that story and they'll be like that's fantastic that's amazing like kid from poor background made a ton of money that's really really good and it and it is good and you know I wouldn't be able to afford to do what I do now if it wasn't for that but the actual experience of it was like weirdly quite traumatic I remember see like if I had about 100 Grand I would have gone home to my parents to be like I've got 100 Grand I would tell my mate so I got 100 grand um yeah I would have told my girlfriend over 100 Grand but like 400 Grand just seemed like an inhuman amount of money it felt like the kind of money that you couldn't tell anyone about it felt like I felt like how can I tell my I went out and I sat down next to this guy whilst I worked this girl sky and you could see I was upset and he said go out and like sit down and I remember just thinking like I think about my dad you know what I mean he worked my dad worked for post office for 35 years and he was probably never making much more than 20 grand and he used to start work he used to leave the house at like 5 a.m and the train needs to go past the back of my house and my mum would wake me up and we'd try and look at him like wave at him going past the house and obviously that's dark you know you see him and you think about how hard he worked day after day after day for 20 grand a year and then here's me just 10 23 sit at a desk you know for a year 400 Grand it just seemed like you're all a sudden different to everybody you knew right how you're sort of disconnected exactly it's that that is 100 Grand is like gift 400 Grand that buys you out of your family buys you out of your friend group I remember like I went around my mate's house and we were playing like Pro Evo and um they're all talking a lot a lot of them worked in finance oh did you get a bonus oh yeah I got five grand I I got like seven Grand and then one of them said did you get a bonus and I hadn't told anyone and I just thought you know what these are like my closest friends I'm just gonna [ __ ] tell them right so I told him I got 395 Grand and you could just like hear like the silence I fill the room of this like this like shock and it was almost and then it started to feel like it started to feel like a cruel thing to tell people in a weird way I made this amount of money and it was a and it's I know it's bizarre but I think in a weird way it was a cruel thing to happen to me and I know that sounds crazy but it's just that level of inequality should and you know I made a lot more than that in following years you know what I mean but like it shouldn't exist it shouldn't happen you know what I mean it shouldn't and it's it's don't get me wrong right I think that people who work hard are natality and do good things should make money I think we should live in a world where that is possible 100 but like people like me and people where I'm from didn't even know that 400 grams I think somebody could make I had no idea and and then like I was thinking if I've made 400 Grand what if the rest of these [ __ ] make you know what I mean I was just looking around me thinking like what is going on so yeah it was it was a it was a mud experience you were City's most profitable Trader globally at one point is that correct yeah so that was 2011. so basically like so this is after you've lost the money from yeah so this sort of just lending the dollar stopped working basically and I had to realize I had to think that we're gonna have to we're gonna have to figure out a smarter way to make money and um so the history of this is actually quite interesting right so what was an interest rate Trader we're going to get a bit technical here but we'll keep it simple um so in 2008 all the interest rates in the in the rich World collapsed to zero because Central Bank Cuts rates we want to boost the economy the economy is really [ __ ] so everybody cut their rates and then our job became basically to bet on when will rates go up again and rates will go up when the economy recovers you know that's a simplification but you know that's basically what happens and interest rate stays Zero from 2008 until this year basically 2022 which is 14 years and in every single one of those years markets and economies predicted that rates would go up the next year which was wrong 12 13 years in a row which is interesting right like these are the best paid guys in the world to do this thing and they're wrong year after this is like if you studied you know weather forecasting at Uni and you went to work at like the met and you saw that every single year every single day they're like tomorrow's going to be like sunny and 30 degrees you know and they're always wrong so you know this happened in 2008 and they were like it'll get better next year it didn't 2009 the lock code was quite serious maybe next year 2010 The RK world just give it one more year and sort of by sort of late 2010 I've seen these guys be wrong for two and a half years and I I started to think like maybe they're just wrong maybe there isn't a recovery I think the big thing for me was because I came from a poor background and you know I still have the same friends the same family I I could see that things were getting actively worse for people from where I'm from and it was like well how do you expect the idea between cutting behind cutting interest rates is you get people spending money all because you can borrow money cheap you know it's great spend money but I look at the situation of my friends and family that I grew up with these guys are losing their homes right their parents had property they'll never owned property so they're getting they're getting poor year after year how the [ __ ] are they going to start spending money because you give them access to a cheap loan they don't even get access to that money they can't go and borrow money at zero percent you know what I mean so I started to look at this and I started to think I don't see it happening I don't see it happen and I guess I was in this sort of quite unique position because there's not many people that go from poor backgrounds to working in trading nowadays so I could see what it was like for ordinary people and I could also see what it was like for these rich guys working in the city you know it's a bunch of millionaires working she used to think because you started in 2008 you had no sort of Prior expectations whereas somebody has been in the industry 25 years they've seen lots of ups and downs and so there's going to be a bunch of cognitive biases where they say I was here in the mid 80s I was here in the early 90s oh it's here for.com this is just the same but actually you didn't have any of that because yeah this is all you know I guess they're used to interest rates up and down they weren't used to this sort of flat lining I think um but you know I think if you consider how long that went on for you know even at the beginning of 2020 people were still predicting rates going to go up later that year you know that's 12 years 12 years of incorrect predictions incredible I think that I think that's you know we could have a whole discussion about why is that happened and you know I went back to Oxford 2017 2019 and I asked one of the professors we had electoral interest rates um and I went up to him afterwards and I said why do you think we were so we were wrong on this interest rates for so long and he said oh no we always knew rates would stay zero and I was like I didn't know what to say to that because you know this is my job you know I know for the fact that these guys predicted interest rates would go back up every single year and I didn't I was like no you didn't it was like yeah we knew we knew I just said well I'm gonna go home I'm going to send you the data and then we're going to talk about 2017 he said that yeah 2017. even you had Janet Yellen before then putting up U.S interest rates in like 2014 2015 they were saying oh we're gonna try and yeah which eventually came down again yeah and I said so I said in the data and it was oh that's interesting yeah we have been wrong for 10 years and here's a guy right professor of macroeconomics Oxford University he's been wrong for 10 years not only has he been wrong for 10 years in a row he's not realized that he's done that that is the level we are at here of Economics where and and but look at this guy rich guy Rich family he used to wear a nice snakeskin belt you know what I mean he doesn't get hurt does he this guy's wrong 10 years in a row you know of course he never gets hurt of course he doesn't notice you know I mean I always you know I wrote some articles at the beginning of covert saying like this is going to cause a massive increase in inequality it's going to cause a massive increase in house prices it's going to cause a massive inflationary crisis okay at the same time Larry Elliott Like Chief economics editor at the guardian was right and house Bryce are going to collapse okay that was obviously wrong who's punishing Larry Elliott you know what I mean but while wait so at the beginning of covid yeah because that there was briefly a there was briefly a buyer's market because you did have lots of people with like student homes buy to let landlords they just thought you know what this is going to be unoccupied for God knows how long yeah the margins are low you should get rid so you got you did get a big flood of those properties for a brief moment yeah about three four months I remember and it was less that the market fell there was just uncertainty so you could get real value yeah but I think what people were missing was we knew at the beginning of kovid the government is going to give a [ __ ] ton of money out and in the end the government gave out 600 billion pounds which I want to emphasize is 12 000 pounds for every single adult in the country okay that's how much money the government gave out okay and if anyone was bothered to do the analysis which basically nobody was you could see very quickly that that money is going to go overwhelmingly to richest people in the country you could work that out we could go through the logic of that right there's a video on my YouTube where I explained exactly you could see 600 billion pounds gonna go to the richest people in the country they're gonna [ __ ] buy houses what the [ __ ] how's they going to do with it you know that we're literally talking about 100 200 Grand per person of course that's price is going to go and I think there's this real I think the big problem is number one there's very few economies from poor backgrounds right so then they're not really keyed into what's happening and number two they don't get punished if they're wrong they don't get punished if they're wrong they don't get rewarded if they're right this sort of punishment would you like them to see because obviously you mean you mean they be they lose legitimacy and there's no counter incentives right if you're if you're right you get loads of States looking for these guys to be spanked in the streets right yeah at least be acknowledged that they were wrong you know no one even said you know this guy at Oxford University wrong for 10 years didn't even notice you know what I mean at least have you know I I'm from a poor background right I walk onto the trading field within two years I'm famous because I'm the guy who gets it right you know I've been writing articles for like two and a half years now about covid and I'm and you know go go remarkable to the beginning of code with every single thing I said would happen has happened you know but you know I don't get the attention that Larry Elliot gets he's wrong in all his predictions you know and the problem is if you don't have any mechanism by which people who are consistently right get recognized and people who are consistently wrong get shown up for being wrong then you will get [ __ ] analysis of course you will it's obvious isn't it and not only that but it is inevitable you'll end up with the Posh boys club because if you have no mechanism by which people who actually understand but are from don't have the social capital can challenge people who are just chatting [ __ ] but do have the social capital then you will just end up help you know how am I going to people how people are going to find my article you know what I mean you know whereas in the city I could walk into any skyscraping Canary wolf and get paid a million pound a year because these guys will look at my track record and say this guy keeps getting it right so actually there's more of a sort of meritocratic attitude 100 city than in journalism or Academia there is no meritocracy in media and to be honest in my opinion I look at economic analysis in the media that is not analysis that is an entertainment product if you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right and punishing them for being wrong then they are not analyzing they are [ __ ] dancing that's what they're doing you know like if you want them to be right pay them to be [ __ ] right but we're not doing that are we we're not doing that and and if you think at the same time right imagine you are an economist who's good who's really good you know what's happening right you can write an article that's perfectly right and no one will ever [ __ ] read it or you can go and work for [ __ ] Bank of America and get paid a million pound a year you know that is the system that we've built and then we're surprised that the economy goes to [ __ ] you know if you want if you want good analysis at the very least recognize good analysis this nobody's even checking the homework here crazy there is some to well I agree with you entirely but Financial Times certain journalists instead Ambrose Evans Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the telegraph for instance is really good on Russia and the long-term consequence of what's going on there generally speaking I entirely agree with you and like you say the incentives are much harder to shut your Gob and just make loads of money and the incentives aren't there to actually have top top Finance journalists and I agree with you at the BBC which of course is where most people get their media in the UK in most newspapers you might as well not bother being quote unquote informed because you're not being informed but there are some good sources of news surely because you yourself must consume new sources on this stuff so where are they um to be totally honest what I do more than anything else is our trade and I talk to Traders listen there must be there must be there must be creditable but there must be more credible news sources that at least some legitimacy is given to blogs podcasts you tell me there are good individuals you have good individuals who have good analysis um I I was never really a news reader I hired the guy to sit next to me and read the papers and and tell me like what's because that's a great job as a Trader you need to know what people think yeah because as a Trader you don't make money just by being right you make money by being right specifically when other people are wrong so it's actually like the art of understanding the way in which people are wrong you know what I mean by that because if everybody knows something it's not monetized it's not valuable exactly yeah um to be honest I mean I watch the news now largely because I've moved away from purely financial analysis and now I'm in I'm in a space where what I want to do is explain to people what's happening to change the way that they view it and the way that they act so I need to know what you're being told so I can explain to you why it's wrong there are good people who do good analysis there's oh I forget the names now there's the Norwegian guy the financial times I spoke to him should remember his name he's quite good um but to be honest when it comes to economics like I I trade I trade that's what I do in terms of long-term Market signals in terms of political risk and you think this might happen or this might happen where are you where are you saying oh that's good information then so I talk to Traders the long-term implications for instance of uh Russia's invasion of Ukraine and what that means for the kinds of the kind of Trades you you'd be involved in yeah clearly you need to source of information about that because you're not in Ukraine um yeah I mean I think it's important basically to know what you know about what you don't know about I think that actually in my opinion the economic significance the more Ukraine is obviously a terrible thing right but the economic significance of it in this country I think has been significantly overplayed in my opinion I think that the inflation that we're seeing is specifically in energy markets of course it's affected the energy markets right but you know look what's happening to London housing look what's happening to London rents that you know Vladimir Putin didn't do that you know and I've been saying for the beginning of kovid yeah we're gonna we give me 600 billion pounds to rich people if you don't expect an inflation in Christ after that then you don't understand money so you would put let's say we're well we're we're at 10 now and and we don't know where we're going it was scheduled to go significantly higher we don't know because there's a big intervention from government you would say actually the inflation we're seeing in this country is more to do with quantitative easing and printing money than Vladimir Putin I would say it's to do with the the very large government deficit during covid and who ended up with that money I think people people don't realize that there's two sides of the balance sheet right if the government gives that 600 billion pounds then somebody gets 600 billion pounds 600 billion pounds is a [ __ ] a lot of money right that's 12 000 pounds per adult in the entire country so if you don't have 12 000 pounds more cash now than you had three years ago someone's got your 12 000 pounds that's a lot of [ __ ] money and if you you know if we assume that that all went to top 10 right which I think is a good sort of first order approximation that means every single adult in the top 10 richest people in the country getting 120 Grand cash that [ __ ] happened you know and and where did that cash go well they're gonna well I think the thing is the interesting thing is you can't get rid of it once it's out there right it only circulates right so they're gonna first thing they do is they try and buy assets because that's what rich people do so that's why we saw this massive boom in the stock market that's why we saw these massive movement house prices but the thing about that is that doesn't get rid of the money right I try and buy your house you try and buy my house we're just topping the money between us so the prices go up what you will see is some richer people buying the houses of poorer people and that will often happen generationally so for example a lot of my friends on poorer backgrounds who've been like saving up really hard 70 80 grand deposits nowadays you can't buy a house with 78 Grand deposit in London suddenly they're competing with the kids of richer families their parents giving them their 300 Grand and then so they don't get the house so what you see is generationally houses that would have been bought by kids from poor families are now being bought by kids from richer family so you do see a lot of asset ownership in the pool but essentially the money doesn't disappear it just circulates if the government gives money out until the government taxes it back people will have more money and the big question is who will have more money and that is the question that nobody was asking during Kobe do you think Constable was a mistake then because obviously that that creation of more money isn't just a response to covert that's been the default alongside low interest rates since 2008. that's a really good question and my answer is actually no and I think that might surprise some people when I say what I said that you know inflation was caused by the government giving money out and by the low interest rates you might think that I'm opposed to the government giving money out of low interest rates I'm not the government had to do that I'm not opposed to follow at all I'm not opposed to the massive deficits the government ran during covid at all those had to be done otherwise people have literally died right people would have not paid the rent people would become homes we would have not been able to eat had to be done but at the same time if you're giving out 600 billion pounds you have to do an analysis of who's going to end up with this money and if that analysis had been done then we would have seen well we're injecting a [ __ ] massive amount of money to the rich hit a massive amount and then you know we had the period of lockdown when that money wasn't damaging because the rich couldn't really spend it because they're locked at home right we could have used that one and a half years two years to say okay we have to do this thing which is going to make the rich [ __ ] Rich so we use the time we have to work out a way to tax them effectively to take that money back you know if you give 600 billion pounds to the rich and you don't want to see effect you have to find ways to take that money back and we had a year and a half where we could have had a sensible conversation about okay look covered [ __ ] we had to do this thing and it's going to massively increase inequality we need to figure out how to stop that from happening and we didn't have that conversation because nobody was talking about who's going to end up with this money so the problem is not that the money was given out and the problem is not the low interest rates the problem is we have an economic system here that is very happy to give tons of money to the rich and has no mechanism of reliably getting money from the rich that is [ __ ] not sustainable and what the thing that really worried me now you see Energy prices going up what's the solution 150 billion pounds direct from the government to the energy companies so if you believe my analysis that the government deficit and increasing inequality caused inflation their solution is another massive government deficit that will increase inequality and I went out and I sold a [ __ ] on the government bonds because I was like these guys are trying to fix inflation with inflation listen you need to have the systemic ability to take wealth away from rich people because there's a massive systemic Force to give wealth to rich people if every time there's a crisis you give a [ __ ] ton to the rich and you have no mechanism of taking money back from the rich then you will impoverish and bankrupt your government and your [ __ ] middle class and we're seeing it in front of our eyes and what frustrates what frustrates me the most is just a lack of a discussion of listen we Encore video gave him 600 billion pounds with no mechanism of getting it back from them well we've actually just reduced their taxes I mean that is I mean that was the one of the maddest things I've seen in my life and um yeah I mean but when I saw that I I got very emotional when I saw that when I saw that you know and this is for you and for me right when I saw that I thought this is because me and people like me have not explained clearly enough to the people of this country that if the government gives you 10 pounds and the rich a thousand pounds you are getting poorer because in kovid the average family accumulated like one two grand cash and every Rich family accumulated like 300 Grand cash okay and that had the obvious predictable consequences right money is not real resources if I give you 100 quid and him 100 Grand you have gotten poorer so after covid people had more money explain that because they would say no we both got richer but okay so they've just got much Rich than I have let's break this down about money is not food money is not energy money is not housing money is not Health Care okay if we give everybody money we have not increased the amount of actual resources and assets we have in our society okay so you don't make Society richer by giving people money you make Society richer by creating and having more resources and assets so if I give everybody more money all that happens is the prices go up but if I give you a bit of money and him a lot of money then he gets richer and you get poorer because you have a bit more money but the prices have gone up relative to both of your increases in in money so I think this is the thing I want and the reason I'm hammering this down is because they did that in covert and they got away with it and to be honest the the conservative government lucked out with the Ukraine war because that took the entire blame for the inflation which in my opinion was caused by their massive increasing inequality and because they got away with it I I'm not surprised to see them do it again because what they did in the tax cuts was quite interesting right they cut the taxes on Ordinary People by a little bit like 50 Quid a month and that's the basic let's just put our audience yes we've got a bunch of tax cuts here so corporation tax didn't go up we'll park that for a moment the basic rate which we all pay cut by one percent but that benefits wealthier people far more than ordinary people well yeah they cut the basic rate by one percent it doesn't really give you that much more money it's like 50 Quid a month you know and only if you're like like a higher midlearn if you're a low mid learner it doesn't benefit you at all right but they cut your taxes a tiny bit and then they cut the taxes of millionaires by like 50 Grand and then my mate called me up he's from an ordinary background and I was explaining it to him and he was like you know I think my mates might be happy because they got this 50-grid tax cut right and people need to understand if the government gives you 50 Quid and the rich 50 Grand you will have more money and you'll get less food less energy less housing less healthcare because money is the asset that we use to determine the distribution of real assets money does not make people Rich money is how we determine distribution you can have as much money as you want right if it doesn't buy you housing if it doesn't buy you food it doesn't matter it doesn't matter does it so people need to understand that because the government has struck on this idea here where we give every poor person a bit of cash I mean give every rich person a ton of cash and then the end result is prices go up to a ton and ordinary people that don't understand why they're getting poorer why because I've got more money why is it happening and it's not just the inflation obviously like you said wealthy people they don't need to spend money they've already got loads of money so they've pumped that into assets and then of course the assets are generally ways for them to make more money because they're living off the revenues from those assets and of course that's the rent here is and that poor people find themselves subjects yeah I always say this you know we talk about sugar down economics if you give the money that their wealth career is like the [ __ ] Gandalf or something right if we give the money they'll boost the economy listen if you give these guys money they're gonna [ __ ] buy your mom's house that is what they're going to do listen my friends mums had houses and my friends will never have houses those houses are not [ __ ] disappearing those houses are owned by rich people's kids now that is what this means this is ordinary families losing their [ __ ] homes and they will they will never have houses again their kids won't have houses they're grandkids that is what this this is serious you cannot give all of your assets away and expect not to be poor not only that but we're giving the assets away to this group of rich people who are internationally mobile and don't pay any [ __ ] taxes I think it's it's you know I was not born and raised political I do this because it was my job to look into the future and tell you what is going to happen to the economy if we do not find a way to tax rich people seriously the future of this economy is going to be a disaster it's going to be a disaster because the government's going further into debt ordinary families are losing their homes all they know families going further into debt and the homes are going to the rich and the deadest of the Rich and it's as you say what that means then is you pay more rent to the rich you pay higher mortgages to the rich so as inequality gets bigger the cash flows from ordinary families to the rich get bigger which means inequality will get bigger still so it creates this really negative spiral you know this is all it's not an optimistic Outlook but that is why I do what I do and but the thing that is most maddening is and also the thing which can give us a bit of Hope is it's fixable because those assets have not disappeared they are owned by the rich and if we fix our tax system we can we can we can get them given back to ordinary families you've got a quote here which I'm going to refer to you've been a successful Trader we've talked about that you're academically credentialed we talked about that I mean it helps to be good in both Fields because then people can't try and discredit you uh you did maths and economics at the lse and for like you say at Oxford but you've said quote throw your textbooks in the bin if you want to really learn about economics so you've already talked about that one academic who's thought it wasn't a serious guy you're basically saying look if you want to know what the story is don't bother with the sort of fussy Dons that these allegedly top universities yeah that is a line from this scouse Trader I used to work with who is the only Trader I worked with didn't go to university he's for Liverpool and he worked on the cash desk when he was 18 and he worked his way up to being like the top Trader at Citibank and I was a Citibank stock Trader in 2011 and he was Citibank stock Trader in 2008 2009 2010 2012 2013. this guy was a [ __ ] genius and when I got smashed that when I lost eight million dollars at one week I bought my instinct as a good economic student was to go and bring my textbooks in and start reading it and being like what's happening he came up to me just [ __ ] grabbed him and he threw him in the bin and he was like listen how [ __ ] old are you and I was out there 23 24 whatever you are not going to learn about it from those [ __ ] books you want to learn about the economy go out onto the street you know walk down the High Street see what shops are closing down look at what the adverts are on the tube you know what I mean is there more homeless people that you're seeing ask your mum about her financial situation ask your friends and your friends mums about their financial situation that is the [ __ ] economy and look I'm not saying nobody should study economics all right but you you should be using your study of Economics to get you into a situation where you can analyze the real world and I'm going to use an example to to illustrate the problem that we have here okay so this professor that the snakeskin belt Professor he um what was the Battle do you know the belt make was a Gucci or something that's really awesome I don't think he'd tell me he's not my biggest fan um he he wrote a paper where he said that if the European Central Bank didn't do QE European GDP would be like 4.7 low or something like that and I was quite pleased to see him make a firm prediction for once because these guys very rarely make fun predictions and I put my hand up and I said to him do you think that's right and he was like what do you mean and I was like do you think he's right he's like I don't understand the question I was like do you think if that hadn't have happened GDP 4.7 lower he was like I don't know what you mean and this guy he is not analyzing the economy he's writing [ __ ] papers you know he doesn't care if it's right he doesn't even think about whether it's right you know I asked him once why do you think people are not have not been spending money since 2008 and he said I'm not really sure but I think it's because of an exogenous shock to consumption savings preferences and yeah I've asked a lot of people nobody ever told me that was [ __ ] why you know what I mean and I think but maybe they said it in other words which is there was this goal of natural crisis which then changed people's options the more you understand what that means the matter it is because an exogenous shock is a technical term referring to economic modeling it means something happened outside of our model right and I've asked him something about the real world and his answer is something changed outside the model that is [ __ ] insane that is an insane thing to say and a professor should be he should be ashamed to say something like that so what he's saying the global financial crisis was an exogenous shock exactly so you cannot describe things in the real world as exogenous shots that means something outside the model changed well no for instance so like you could say in the early 1970s you have a massive rise in inflation because there is an exogenous shock which is the global oil crisis yeah but you say what the shock is yeah you know you said it happened because of the oil crisis okay something over there changed yeah but you can't just describe a real world change as an exogenous shock in general well something changed on [ __ ] Jupiter on Mars he was just saying long words because he didn't really have a problem the problem is he but the first he's obfuscating his own lack of knowledge but the biggest problem is he thinks that's a legit answer and that is the problem when you have people who these guys who live so much in the models and care so little about the real world that they don't even realize that they're talking about models anymore you you need to be coming to grips with the real world and what is happening in the real world and this is why I get frustrated about the lack of sort of class representation in economics because they can get away with that because they're [ __ ] rich and they don't get hurt you know whereas it's my mates who [ __ ] lose their [ __ ] homes it's interesting I remember having a sort of interaction with an economist recently actually I think it's former formerly at the bank of England I can't remember what it was he was on some subcommittee it wasn't like you know it wasn't a big cheese but it's a relatively sort of esteemed Economist and I think I said some throwaway remark like somebody says something about growth and I said mate this little crap go down a High Street you know I live I live in Portsmouth I go down that I can go down to the Town Center City Center I can tell you all Bournemouth where I'm from yeah we ain't growing and we're not going to see real meaningful economic growth for a long time and he said well that's literally why we have economics so we don't have to like go down the street and see what's going on oh my God but what's crazy is the Bank of England even has methodologies which include survey data going to talk to people and saying how do you feel we have you know survey data about um consumer confidence business investment confidence but like you say like they just think it's the models and like this is reality and the actual living organism out there where we do these transactions in real life that's that's just I forget about it that doesn't matter yeah almost but what's the point if you know I always remember when Russell Brand was getting involved and a lot of my mates were back home right Russell Brand he's from not far where I'm from right when he was and he went on news now and at that time it was E15 moms you remember 15 months a bunch of mums in Stratford who were losing their homes and we're getting kicked out of the area where they where they lived and he'd spoken to them and he went on and he spoke to it was Evan Davis at BBC and I thought he gave quite like a emotional like you know a genuine like police like the plight of these people look what's happened to these people and Evan Davis turned around and showed him a 150-year graph of per capita wage growth 150-year graph right which is and it's an average right it's an average right so that could be dragged up by the super rich right yeah and he showed him this graph and he said well you know yeah I can see what he's saying but look you're wrong I've showed you this 150 graph and it's this that is sickening to me that is sickening to me because here's a guy who's telling you look people from where I'm from are losing their homes and the guys turn around and say well actually I've done the [ __ ] numbers and it's everything's fine and you know he Evan Davis can say that to me because I've got [ __ ] two economics degrees and I can turn around to him and say well that's a [ __ ] average who [ __ ] cares if it's just a bunch of [ __ ] millionaires dragging it up doesn't help my mates doesn't help the E15 mums a [ __ ] comedian you can't show him 150 degrees [ __ ] what's that was it GDP what was it it was what per capita wage growth I think you can find you can go over look at on YouTube but I mean but that stuff also it's like look after you get the Industrial Revolution for the first 40 50 years there isn't actual meaningful improvements and living standards that only happens when you get industrial action strikes revolutions riots because the rolling class realize okay well we can't do this forever and and the thing is Evan Davis will know something like that it's called the angles pause it's named after Frederick Engels interestingly enough we'll go on to the next question Evan Davis was one of the people who uh pioneered the poll tax policy and if you know that I didn't know that yeah he raising in my estimation even yeah he worked he worked in a think tank in the late 80s I can't remember which one it was so I won't say but it's one of these sort of pro pro thatcherite think tanks and and he was one of the the minds behind the poll tax policy which is one of the most unpopular economic policies in the history of this country and now he's just viewed as sort of some Centrist you know clever BBC political economics Finance voice yeah I mean it shows you how extreme those voices really are let's talk about the Tory mini budget yeah um which became this massive news story people who are watching this probably heard look I know what guilts are but I don't talk about them very often yeah yeah they heard lots of words like guilts for the first time just kind of briefly explain what actually happened okay so yeah let's break it down from Basics so the very first thing is they announce um a big package of spending and also tax cuts um the big thing which wasn't expected was they had this cut of the 45p rate which the first thing to say is that rate kicks in at 150 Grand it doesn't affect you if you're 150 Grand because it's only above 150 Grand so really you're only significantly cutting tax on people who earn like 200 300 400 a grand or a million pound a year so it's a big tax cut specifically for very high earners markets weren't expecting that and Traders looked at that and so the next thing to say is you know these were unfunded tax um tax cuts and what that means is the government is planning to borrow that money so you know it means we're getting less money in we're having to spend more money on things like energy we're going to borrow the difference and when you borrow money when the government borrows money it doesn't just come out within it they borrow it from people essentially from rich people and those decisions of whether to lend it or not are made by Traders and the Traders look at the government and they think well you know Kobe's finished now and we're in a more ordinary Economic Times and you're planning to run a massive deficit just to stuff rich people's pockets with cash right and you know if you're going to run massive deficits in normal times you know you don't have to be a genius to be like well how are you going to pay that back then basically and Traders basically thought okay well this is not a coherent plan so probably one of two things will happen you're a student of History you will know that historically when governments have borrowed massive amounts of money the way they've paid it back normally is through inflation so if you have very high inflation prices go up price go up and wages also go up and your tax take Rises significantly the debt stays the same size because it's fixed in nominal terms and then it's easy to pay back that's how the second world award that was paid back so Traders are looking it's thinking well they're not serious about paying it back so maybe they're going to inflate it away not only that but they're given a crap ton of money out so that's going to cause inflation so they start selling the pound because you don't want pounds it's going to be inflation right you know it means basically it means the pound is worth less you can't get as much for it they start selling the pound pound starts falling the bank of England whose job is to keep inflation at two percent look at that and they say Okay number one government's giving a crap ton of money out number two pounds foiling which means our input is going to cost them all the inflation situations looking even worse so people are looking at the bank of England and thinking okay they're gonna rise rates raise rates massively and this is in a context of already even before the budget we're talking about rates going up to five five and a half percent so suddenly they're thinking okay maybe it's going to go up to six and a half seven percent and if you know the bank of England is going to raise rates then you're gonna you're not going to lend to the government unless you can get a similar rate right you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lend the government for zero if I can get four or five percent from the bank of England so suddenly the bank of England but the government bonds also got up to four and a half percent and this creates a panic basically because everybody starts selling the government bonds Pension funds a lot of people's pensions are invested in government bonds they start collapsing and it basically just creates a broad Market panic because Traders are looking at the government and thinking they don't have a plan they don't have a plan like they're not going to pay the debt back are they going to inflate it away the central bank is going to raise the rates people start thinking well if rates go up to five six seven percent what does that mean for mortgages you know I think this is the big question right you know if the bank of England rate goes up your mortgage will go up and you know we all know how big mortgages are especially London but also in the rest of the country and if you can fund that two percent fine but can you fund it at 10 can you find it at eight percent well there's this amazing data isn't there which says basically obviously people love to talk about 1990 15 interest rates but because obviously house prices are so much higher now people have got much larger mortgages actually interest rates at five six percent now would feel like 15 in 1990 yeah and this seems kind of lost on yeah a lot of analysis yeah exactly you know house prices are a lot lot higher now than they were in the 80s and you know you know the reality of the situation is a lot of people you know even people who are not that poor are going to be brought into situations where they can't pay the mortgage you know a lot millions of people you know that's and then you start questioning you know the economy of the whole country you know it's these guys and and the maddest thing of it all is this this situation was created simply so the government gave a tax cut to Millionaires and it's one of the maddest things I've ever seen um and it created this Carnage eventually the bank of England was forced to come in and agree to start lending money to the government again you know there's talk about is this Q is this not QE but the bank of England eventually came in and backstopped the the bonds the government bonds start to lend money to the government um and you know I talk to Traders and they're looking at the government and they're just thinking what are these guys playing it's such a [ __ ] up you know I think a lot of people think oh this was the plan this was not the plan this was not the plan I think they thought they'd get away with it and um yeah they couldn't but you know even now they've basically backed backed away you know the u-turned on it and I predicted they would you turn up a video on Sunday the reason I predicted that U-turn by the way is because I started on the 45p on the 45p top three it's because I started getting texts from people I don't get texts from you know what I I live in these worlds now you know I'm writing a book and I'm in this sort of publishing world you know I'm in the media world now I'm getting techs and people who are not poor saying this policies [ __ ] and it's because they've got mortgages right you know they've got massive mortgages a lot of people are not poor I've got big you know it's not the poorest people have the mortgages because they can't get mortgages right yeah and you know these guys work in the media they were and you know even these guys some of them you know I guarantee you those Tory back benches they are their kids they've got mortgages you know so what the conservative government did here you know yeah I don't need to tell you these guys have been hurting the poor for a long time but suddenly they took this big step to hurt homeowners and you know a lot of people in the media are homeowners or not I I just thought the media is not going to accept this and if the media doesn't you know they need the media to to go with it for it to happen the media wouldn't accept it they're gonna have to back down it eventually did well that's the big difference to austerity isn't it and that's kind of what frustrates me the most with this stuff is that after 2010 to 2015 the bottom 25 of this country were destroyed they were crushed and the middle class the upper middle class like say if your height you can be even Ultra Rich if you're highly leveraged on loans for property you might be a buy select landlord or whatever you're terrified by all of this right and they've got a glimpse of that and within a week like it was just amazing to see how radicalized they became and it's like welcome to reality for the rest of the for the country right yeah but I think this is kind of you know the rich have got unbelievably richer in the last 15 years um and personally I think that the conservative party is basically behind this but there comes to a point where you've cut everything you know the welfare state is cut to a bare minimum enough they cut that back further it's going to be and it looks like they might you're going to see real it's going to be bad right and it's difficult to cut stuff there but then then how do you make the rich richer how do you keep making the rich richer and you know the only assets left are the houses of the middle class now you know so it comes to a point where you know you need to hit those people if you want to make the rich richer anymore you know because the economy is not growing so the only way the rich get richer is taking assets from the rest of us you know we've cut their taxes we've cut you know government services um and now I think the conservatives are in this bind where it's like how do you keep that machine going without hitting your core motorbikes which is homeowners you know and I think they're I think they've really stuck here because you know they the only thing you can do here to prevent an economic collapse is tax the rich and it's like their reason to be that they can't do that so I think that they they tried this thing which is well why don't we if you if you look at it in a sense it's a clever strategy right because it worked in covid give ordinary families a bit and they're rich a lot um but the problem is and I think this is like a great irony and something that people who are on the left such as yourself and myself should ask ourselves the people who stopped that it wasn't us it was financial markets and we need to be sending that message look they are taking your assets and giving it to the rich and they're making you poorer and you know I think this is an opportunity because the conservatives need that wedge to be between the middle and the port yeah they need that witch to be there but at the same time there's nothing left to take from the port so you know we need to convince the Middle look these guys are not going to help you in the long run you know where are your kids going to live how's your kid going to afford a house where your grandkids gonna live yeah you know we and we need to make the explanation look I know they're giving you money but they're giving the rich a ton of more money than they're giving you and that will make you poorer we need to build that understanding what I think is ironic is sort of the riot has sort of built itself on economic credibility and like the empowerment of individual and yet they are destroying the financial lives of all the new families and I think it's a great feeling of us that we haven't managed to explain to ordinary Families how Bleak their future is on this path and that's you know that's what I try through on my YouTube that's like my sort of Mission to explain look and then so I think it's it's where we are now is bad but that creates this opportunity to build this broader Coalition yeah that unites the middle and and poorer people and says look this doesn't work for any of us one of the most frustrating things for me though is people are saying this is the Tories and then when labor come back in you know things will be fantastic some things will obviously be significantly better but like you say our economic model is about generating revenues for a certain group of people they're looking around for sources of wealth what are they NHS and like you say that the housing assets of the middle class in this country and they will gobble them up because that's how it works whoever the government is that's where the pressure will come from housing 2023 since we're talking about it what's going to happen to the housing market you said that you were right when Larry Elliott was wrong about house prices during covert what happens next year so I'm actually quite confident and most people won't agree with me on this that in the medium to long-term house prices will go up and the reason for that is because the government's giving a ton of money out and and that money's ending up with the rich and that will you know ritual buy assets and that will push broadly assets up obviously in the short term we've got massive headwinds which is this massive increase in interest rates so I think in the short term Anything Could Happen um I actually think so I was of the opinion that interest rates would come back down because ordinary families you know the bottom 70 80 are being so squeezed by what's happening that they will not be able to spend and that means inflation will be quite short-lived and that means the rates will come back down but then what I saw was that the government is planning to fix that by running another massive deficit and you know I know you know your history this has happened before right if the government gives out a ton of money that creates inflation and then tries to deal with it by giving out a ton of money that does not bode well for long-term inflation and long-term value of the currency um so I sort of start to think well actually maybe we could enter a bit of a spiral here where inflation stays high and interest rates Stay High but then what happened is the market rejected that so I think it depends on what the government does and unfortunately both outcomes are bad right if the government decides to just churn money out which ends up going ending up with the rich then you will see a big rise in interest rates and a big rise in inflation and that caused this this kind of conflict right because in the long run assets have to go up but people can't get mortgages and I think what that would lead to in the end is basically people who have used mortgages about to sell their houses to the people who have the cash because I mean you and I sit here and you think oh interest rates go up that makes it hard to buy a house a ton of people don't need a mortgage to buy a house nowadays because the really rich are stacking up so much cash and they are the guys who get paid the high rates of interest on this cash um but now it looks more likely and this is very up in the air we don't know what the government's going to do that they're going to move towards a kind of austerity light model and I think that will probably take us if they do that to a more post 2008 situation where it's in miseration for ordinary people inflation will eventually come down because the middle class has their spending power so badly hit and house prices end up going up because the rich have so much money and they need they want assets they want to buy they want to buy things with that money um and I think that think that's the bigger risk because I think people don't realize how much it a lot of people in the middle of society economically don't realize how much it hurts their family especially their kids and their grandkids when house prices go up um I think that is the risk but medium to long term I'm very confident that house prices will go up and and you know that's a very that's a very um anti-consensus View at the moment but the fact is and this is the thing people keep missing and I've missed it since the beginning of covid the rich are stacking up so much cash here and they're not going to sit on it they're going to use the biases and I think I think one thing that will have to happen is the government will end up being forced to relax mortgage requirements because you're doing this right that's right 50 in mortgage products they need to keep people being homeowners but they also want to make the rich richer well how do you do that bigger mortgages then you can own your home technically you own your 800 900 Grand home but you also owe 800 Grand debt to the rich so you you've got the home but they've got the actual wealth so I think that will happen um and I think the way that we fight that is we have to make this connection between the distribution and the quality of life of ordinary people we have to make that connection because if we don't make that people's lives get worse they don't understand why they're like well I've got more money my house price is going up I should be richer but if if you are getting relatively poorer then you you'll get less stuff you know we've had in the last three years the biggest and fastest ever increasing inequality in the country and the biggest and fastest decrease in living standards in in peace time and no one's connecting the two and I think it's such an opportunity that we're missing we need to say look you are getting poorer because of that increasing inequalities it's not it's not a complicated connection you know you increase inequality you improve their living standards you decrease yours I'm kind of surprised actually the middle class aren't more angry about it like the people that shop shop at waitrose very affluent looking to retire in a couple of years there's many many people like that who are very very I'm not saying they all vote labor or Tory or lib Dem they do all three or they don't vote at all but they know that they're really [ __ ] their kids and their grandkids they know that that's the connection we need to make but but they know that don't they I mean that's because there's polling out there for instance about should house prices fall yeah it's really interesting yeah yeah and actually over 50 of the public say it would be in the public interest for house prices too full that doesn't mean they want house prices to fall because it's not necessarily in their rational self-interest but they know what needs to happen yeah there must be there's a lot of guilt out there surely amongst those people you know there's this article which always appears in the newspapers which is how I bought a house by saving up and stop buying coffees and famously it always has like in there and then I got 300 grand for my mum like hidden in there those articles in my opinion are to assuage the concerns of older Property Owners because older Property Owners which is massively the voting base of the conservative party have been to a large degree protected you know so you know my parents have always been poor but they own their own property and that means that very likely they'll be able to live to some degree comfortably until their retirement they'll probably have to just save that property right and they'll lose the home but they've been protected even though they've been poor their whole lives right but if they were to look more broadly to look at their kids and say oh well you know how are my kids going to be they'd be like they'd have to look realistically and be like [ __ ] that's what they earn that's the house prices what's their pension what's their retirement look like how do I have elderly people don't want to think about that and then if the media tells you well listen don't worry you know what kids are like they're a bit silly they waste their money they'll sort out they'll stop buying the coffees they'll stop buying that stuff and they'll be okay those articles are there to tell and you know it's it's easy to convince someone something they want to believe right you know those guys go out there and sell to older people that we you're protected and we know it might look bad for your kids but don't worry we've got that they don't have that and we need to counter that missing and it's not easy because our message is in some ways unpalatable which is if we stay on this path your kids and your grandkids will have very very difficult economic lives but we need to make that case and you know those are the people in a sense that we need to win and you know it's their kids and their grandkids being hurt and we need to find a way to communicate to them clearly and compassionately so they don't feel attacked look we are trying to protect your kids and your grandkids we're not attacking you you know where are your kids going to live what is their life going to be like are your kids going to be able to afford to have kids of their own you know that is the message that I think we need to be making if there's a young person watching this and they're thinking I really want to get on the housing ladder yeah um and then there's loads of calculations that play right do I need to maybe move um what should I prioritize etc etc presumably you would still it's not often on Navara media we talk about financial advice but presumably you would therefore say it and given what you said five minutes ago about you think house price will continue to go up but they should do that I've been saying this you know consistently if you could don't wait for the market to go down if you can do it get on the ladder if you can if you can listen if you don't have property that's not a flat position your short one property because you've got to live somewhere you know the first thing you should be looking to do and and I totally understand that in today's economy that means taking 300 400 if you're in London 600 700 Grand of debt maybe and that is risky and that is unappealing and I wish that we were not in that situation but the truth is if you don't own a property you are in very precarious financial position and the best way you can get yourself out of that is to get yourself a property and you know I wish that didn't mean taking a massive massive mortgage and I can't pretend to people that you're not taking a massive Financial Risk of buying a property but the truth is you are also taking a massive Financial Risk and not buying a property because look what's happening to rent look what's happening to house prices you know there's people in London now they don't even know where they're going to live you know and you know if you don't have a property you're a short one property you need to get that just to make yourself secure and and I have to say when I say that that I know I know full world that that is advice that is impossible for a lot of people and I understand that of course um but that is you know I have to tell people the honest truth um and and if you are in a situation where you can't then you know support me follow my Channel people like you so we can come out and explain look that it could be possible if we change things I mean I'll I'll provide an example here so I left I left London because I'm with my now wife because we wanted to have children and we knew that we had to own somewhere to do that because we we couldn't we'd love to rent if you had five year ten years you didn't have a massive increase Etc and kind of sort of security around housing that you say maybe have in Germany we don't have that here so we knew that we had to buy it somewhere that meant we had to move out of London we did buy somewhere on the south coast and doing that just just open my eyes so much as the J it's even worse than you think if you're renting how rigged the system is the minute we we access the mortgage we didn't pay any um stamp Duty that went uh we then that house in two years has gained more in value than I've earned working we actually bought in a really good moment right at the beginning of the covert crisis where lots of like I say sort of student property developers just wanted to get rid of their assets right yeah and I just feel like and then as we're remortgaging fortunately we remortgages for all this happened yeah you've got people saying yeah you can you can borrow against the increase in the value of the house and you think this is nuts and yet there are tens of millions of people in this country who think it's not normal not acceptable they're virtuous and it's like you keep on being rewarded for being lucky and then you get rewarded again and rewarded again the people who actually down on the luck because they couldn't get the initial cash capital for Deposit they keep on being punished and I just feel like how do we get that I know I know renters know they're in a bad situation but it's like it's so much worse than you even realize yeah I mean it's you know I I you know my channel is it's mainly about all economics and politics but we do do sort of we talk about investing we talk about buying property and um it's hard because I get so many messages like you know what can I do to make money and the truth is like you know in the last few years we've seen this big increase in sort of crypto and online trading and um it sells the stream you can sort of invest away to wealth but the truth is you know like I I live off of my assets you know I'm a wealthy Division I live off of my assets you know if you come if you come to me with like 500 Grand then and you can if you make five percent a year you can make 25 Grand you can live off that if you come to me with 10 15 grand you make five percent a year you know you're not even going to make 100 pounds you know so it's sort of this is and the thing is I want to tell people this buy a property if you can because it's a good Financial advice but I just know it's impossible and then that's why I think what's really interesting you look at the journey that Martin Lewis has been on Martin Lewis money saving expert I guess people know here's this guy that's like protect your interests do what's good for you change your mortgage provider change your electricity provider and now he's coming out with you have to fight the government because because the problem is they the rich have all the money in all the assets you are not going to beat them in that game the only Power you have the only Power you have is that there's more of you and if you try and use that by trading crypto you don't use that power it's like it's like the Kung Fu movies where 100 guys fight Bruce Lee one at a time you know we need to explain to people that being political is the best way to protect your financial interest as an individual as a family as a community because it genuinely is I genuinely believe that and if you don't do that you know this thing recently where we suddenly saw you know a lot of like nice well-off people messaging me oh my mortgage rate's going to go up and then the government backs down that is what happened when when you act politically as a community you force government to change and I also understand that a lot of people are struggling financially and they struggle to have the energy to act politically and you know if you don't have anything to give don't give anything but if you if you have a little bit of space a little bit of energy you need to engage with this because you are under attack your houses are under attack your living stands are under attack and the only way to push back is to be political and and you know I come from poor background and people I don't want to be political but the truth is this is what happens if you're not political you know there's a fight going on if you don't fight it you lose hmm yeah going back to that thing about um renting and Home Ownership yeah because of course if you say well we need and I believe this we need house prices to go down at least 10 15 and then stagnate basically for 20 years and then somebody would say well that means that somebody who's just bought a property here and there might be a young viewer of yours living in I don't know Leicester right and they just bought a nice terraced house nothing special 230 Grand and they're going to go into negative equity okay they go into negative equity let's say for 18 months I'd still rather be in their shoes paying towards an asset which at least in the medium to long term is going to be making cash then renting I don't I I don't understand how people think the negative Spectrum people you say negative equity and people go oh my God they start panicking and say renting is much worse than negative equity I was renting in London for 15 years I lost about 85 Grand renting I've got nothing to show for it yeah and yet in the popular imagination somehow negative equity is like way worse than renting yeah I think what I say the problem actually is the house price to wage ratio if you think about it that's the problem you know it's it's that's not massively you know 20 years ago 30 years ago that was like three or four and now it's like in London 2030 or more so what you really want you can fix the problem without house prices coming down if you allow wages to arise and I think what's interesting is in the last 20 30 years so we have the bank of England who have this mandate to keep inflation down except housing inflation exactly it doesn't look at house prices that inflation does not include house prices so we have a mechanism that allows house prices to go up but does not allow wages to go up and because people want to avoid negative equity we do not allow house prices to come down so we've created an unfixable problem if you let our house prices to go up and you simultaneously will not accept falling house prices or Rising wages then that problem is unfixable and I think we need to accept that we have a problem here and we need to we need to look realistically why is this so big and how do we bring wages up in my opinion the reason that this Market has become so big is because the rich are so [ __ ] rich now and these guys buy assets it's not just houses that have gone up land prices gone up stocks have gone up luxury cars have gone up luxury art has gone up gold has gone up every single asset has rocketed in price because the rich are unbelievably rich people need to understand ultimately there is a competition here for who owns the assets and if you allow the rich to be unbelievably Rich think about it like this right imagine you are Elon Musk is a billionaire whatever right imagine you've got 100 million quid imagine that you're at your net worth 100 million quid you will make on that wealth about 5 million pounds a year let's say four you make four million pounds a year just for getting out of bed how much do you spend per day per year I could live on 15 grand here easily well you're making four million pounds a year yes honestly I mean as being a Schleich 30 grand a year 40 Grand a year it's a sensible person would would spend 200 300 Grand a year live a life of luxury yeah and use the other 3.7 million pounds to buy more assets that's what they do and it's it's not that they're evil I don't hate these people they're not bad people it's just if you're super rich you have a massive income and it happens automatically you just put it in the stock that's the incentives yeah you know and that so you create this vacuum of wealth that sucks whilst out of ordinary family so of course house prices are going to rise because they have got so much money they're going to push it up let me ask you a question that actually relating to this because at Labor Party Conference Kirsten ratliner policy and he said he wanted homeownership to go from 65 to 70 it was 70 in 2003 so yeah important to say we've gone backwards right and that they would do this basically through some government-led mortgage scheme presumably they will provide deposits to people I don't know how they would do it they could be subprime mortgages presumably which are backed by the state I have no idea that to me sounds like oh you're only going to further inflate the mortgage Market though because of course going from 65 to 70 again means you've got a massive increase in demand good I'm happy to do that but that doesn't sound like a solution to me if you're saying we're going to help home ownership by increasing prices and again they're going to outship wage increases I think this is what this is what happens when you when you don't deal with the fundamental problem that inequality is increasing massively you know how do you keep people in homes when inequality is increasing massively you know if you have this constant flow of wealth and assets from ordinary families to the rich then how would you keep them in their homes the only way to do it because homes are ultimately the largest form of wealth in the country the only way to do is have massive increase in debt and this is if you start looking for sort of technocratic solutions this is what will happen you just end up putting people into more and more debt and I think that is what will happen and we need people need to understand that you cannot be rich without assets and the current setup sees an enormous flow of assets and wealth and money every year from ordinary families to the rich you know you make 30 grand you spend all of that on mortgage rent food bills energy that money doesn't disappear it goes to the owner of your house the owner of your mortgage the owner of the food the owner of Tesco the owner of the energy companies right you earn 30 grand you give all of it to the rich and it is that guy Rishi sunak is worth 700 million pounds right you know he will make every year two he'll make 20 million pounds on that every single year and that that's where your mortgage payment goes you know so if you create a system where there's this enormous flow of money wealth assets from ordinary families to the rich then year after year generation after generation ordinary families will get poorer and this fundamentally needs to be fixed until we grasp this problem life will get worse and worse that is exactly why I do the job that I do I don't need to do this you know what I mean I've made a lot of money and I could keep making more money I could go live on a beach in the Philippines but poverty will explode if we don't deal with this let's talk about deficits it's a word that's not mentioned anymore it was very it was very common between 2010 and 2015. um the Tories promised to eliminate the deficit by 2015 when they came into government with the liberal Democrats in 2010. we've been running a deficit since 2010 actually it's important to say we've been running virtually permanent deficits since the late 1970s for the tour is quote unquote balancing the books there's always this this big watch word are they ever going to balance the books which is to say are they ever going to preside over a situation where actually they bring in more through General taxation yeah than they spend through public spending because they promised to do that for years it never happens I think it will probably never happen Okay so you know lots of people have lots of strong opinions on this governments don't need to run surpluses you can run a deficit the reason is because deficits get eroded over time by both economic growth and by inflation so your your debt is fixed in nominal terms inflation pushes the prices up so if you have growth of nowadays you don't get much but if you get one two percent if you have inflation of two three percent then your deficit is naturally falling related to the size of your economy by four or five percent every year so you can afford to run a four or five percent deficit over time you can if that's what you want and it's it's I'm not opposed to deficits at all um I think the last years I've seen some people sort of push this direction of let's run massive deficits and I think the deficit in code was necessary I think the big problem that this sort of people saying let's run massive deficits is it totally defends people like me saying let's tax the rich because if you turn around to me and say there's no problem with deficits even massive ones why tax the rich we just run a massive deficit and then what you do is you politically enable things like covid we're a massive crisis led to a 600 billion pound World transfer to the rich so actually using the mmt people the modern monetary Theory people they've got it completely wrong they're providing the sort of intellectual foundations if they're saying and not all of them do say that we need to run massive deficits don't worry about class struggle don't worry about inequality yeah actually what they're doing is providing a license to yeah you know what the transfer of wealth from world to Rich I don't want to mischaracterize them because it's a big community and different people believe different things and I think the sort of you know the the high Priests of it the people who sort of really into it often they will say well actually mmt does support taxation of the rich the problem is the message that has cut through is definitely so not dangerous and the message that you need to tax the rich has not cut through because I I talk about taxing language all the time and I free frequently get people posting against me you don't need to tax the rich you understand money okay so there's no doubt about it the mmt has persuaded a lot of people you don't need to tax the rich and I think you know and people disagree with this but I think if you just print money and that money ends up with the rich you will increase inequality and and you will decrease living standards you know distribution matters it matters of course it does you can't massively increase inequality and not expect living standards to fall and the last three years have shown exactly that happening so I think I'm not against deficits that you know and of course I'm not pro austerity a government can afford to run a deficit but if you take your eye off of inequality and you say deficits are totally fine we don't really care about what that does to inequality you can't be surprised when the Tory government turns around and say okay well we're going to tax ordinary people's taxes we're going to cut ordinary people's taxes by 100 quid and the richest taxes by 50 Grand you've allowed that right you've allowed that because you've said to them we're not going to fight you in running deficits and we're not going to fight you on inequality so they're going to run a deficit to increase inequality so I think we deficits can be a tool in a certain time of course the power is not unlimited of course the power is not unlimited but if you take it off the ball with inequality and with distribution it will rise you need to watch it so you're talking about taxing the rich but we're often told that imposing higher taxes on profits higher incomes would drive business away from the UK what would your response to that be so the first thing is I'm not talking about tax incomes more I'm talking about taxing wealth more you can tax income less if you want you know what I mean and then you can attract higher earners here if you want but when we talk about driving people away I think the one single only good thing to come out of this war in Ukraine is that the government turned around and suddenly decided they wanted to tax rich people at a very specific subset of rich people which is Russian billionaires and uh Roman Abramovich who of course owns Chelsea Football Club he [ __ ] paid it because you cannot put Chelsea Football Club in a bag you know I think that idea rests on a perception of rich people as if they are guys with like a massive bag of cash okay rich people are rich because they own your houses they own your house they own your mortgage their own [ __ ] Tesco's down the road they own the skyscrapers they own the [ __ ] windmills they own the oil rigs they own the [ __ ] land that makes the food they are rich because they own real assets in this they they're rich because they own this country and they can leave if they want the country will still be here and we can tax the assets where the assets are which is here you know what I mean you know Jeff Bezos owns Amazon but Amazon sells to the UK to the US to Europe to Japan you know what I mean you know these guys can't just all move to the Cayman Islands the assets are in the world you know they own real things and we can tax those real things you know ultimately it's a question of do you want your country to be owned by people who pay tax or people who don't you know and it's they can leave the stuff is here they own your mortgage what they're going to do you you know we can tax that payment when you make it ultimately their money comes from you their money comes from when you when you go to the supermarket when you work when you pay your bills when you pay your mortgage when you pay your rent I think people need to there's one video on my channel called what is world and I'm gonna just plug it because it's to explain these guys are rich because they own assets they own this country of course we can tax it and I think nothing shows that better than Roman Abramovich turning around trying to sell Chelsea Football Club to anyone who's going to buy it because it's there it exists and we can tax it why do you think quasi quaten got rid of their cap on Bankers bonuses because presumably the same argument there right actually it's a little bit different because that's not a tax it wasn't actually raising money they might actually make the argument it'll raise more money because we'll have a larger financial service industry here what was that what was the thinking that you think I'll be honest the the thing I understood the economics of the budget very well in my opinion the thing which I'm struggling to understand is why they did what they did and the most people I speak to are struggling as well um and you know some people say they're ideological I'll be honest a lot of people say that they're idiots a lot of people in the markets genuinely think they're idiots quiz equaling worked in markets and everybody's saying I know this guy that worked with him he said he was an absolute idiot he's got PhD in economic history um I couldn't tell you honestly I think that he probably thinks that it will do you think he thinks it'll play well with a certain demographic he's trying to pitch himself as we are pro-growth and we are pro dynamism yeah one thing I'd say that I think is interesting about bank because I was a banker for a long time I was very poor growing up right that is the kind of policy which you ask 15 year old me doing maths lying on the floor of his front room you know what I mean he'll probably like it you know what I mean because I'm poor and I see a system where you know people around me in London are millionaires and don't pay much tax and I'm thinking well I want to get out that channel you know Finance is aspirational isn't it for people for me it was aspirational you know what I mean so I couldn't tell you for sure and I think it's I mean it's Fallen flat um but I think maybe he's trying to pitch himself as aspirational like that seems to be what they're going for as a brand would it play well with the sort of people you used to work with would they sort of hear that come through in the mini budget statement yeah at Citibank and go [ __ ] you know I've got a good story about this um so I started work in 2008 and in 2009 um I think it was in 2009 it was still a labor government and they were they announced a big increase in tax on the banks right um and I was [ __ ] myself right because I was still poor I'd never been paid you know you know I had a job at a bank but I don't need any money yet and I was like [ __ ] me I work this hard to get here and now they're going to raise taxes on me and I looked around me at the Traders on the desk they were [ __ ] laughing they were [ __ ] laughing because they knew it wouldn't affect them they knew it wasn't affected and I remember this sort of it's weird for someone like me who comes from a poor background to just see this confidence dislike and that was a labor government right this knowledge that look these got and these guys don't worry we got them don't go Nick they're going to come for us it's just it's just it's for the people you know it's it's you know and you know the bank of bonus cap in the reality of it is all it led to was a massive increase in Banker salaries you know so it's a good example of attacks which is for for your image basically it's a messaging tax because it you know essentially it's not tax it's just a change in the structure of pay you know um so I honestly think they probably don't really care they they understand that it's just it's for messaging it's a it's for the conservative part in the way they look on the crypto thing we mentioned it a bit earlier on so tons of working class guys and others as well but it is a thing as far as I can see have sort of been sucked into crypto yeah um are they being conned you know you're somebody that's interested in financial markets and assets and wealth but the way it's being talked about and speculated on particularly on social media it seems a little bit more like a Ponzi scheme am I being unfair basically in my opinion yes listen I live on my investments I I make investments I'm I'm an investor if you want to invest in something you should do your due diligence okay the number one thing that you should check before anything else you probably should need to check it is that the thing that you're buying [ __ ] exists you know these guys it's [ __ ] internet points mate see I yeah I'm gonna get hate on this for the internet that is what it is it's internet points you know and I said this before this crash I've been saying it for a long time these guys are selling your [ __ ] snake oil you know and they're going to take that money that you gave to them to buy your their [ __ ] dog coin and they're gonna buy your [ __ ] mom's house that is what they're gonna buy with it you know you could be saving that money to buy houses and they're selling you [ __ ] points on the internet and and I understand it I understand it you know because I've been there I've been poor you see the guys are making money trading blah blah blah and you know all the guys who you know they're showing on their Instagram I bought a Lamborghini with crypto listen I've come out on crypto so I get the messages from people all right the guys who [ __ ] lost their [ __ ] life savings trading crypto they don't [ __ ] post on Instagram you know it's as simple as that but they message me they message me saying I've lost all my money can you give me some advice I've got this new strategy and I have to message them back saying listen you've got a problem it's an addiction my advice is that you never trade this ever again and you know and you come out and you you once you speak out on it you get these guys flooding to you oh I've lost all my [ __ ] savings and it's you know it's [ __ ] gambling addiction and it ruins it ruins lives of his family and you know also you know these people I've been poor I've been that [ __ ] young dumb full of [ __ ] guy that wants to make a ton of cash you know what I mean I understand it but these people they should be our best fighters to make this [ __ ] system better for ordinary families the guys buying crypto yeah because they're young they've got energy listen I'm getting older now you know what I mean I can't be out every day like pushing this you know but these guys they're getting screwed over by the system and then they're getting sold the [ __ ] fake Cure by the system that's taking all their money come here and help us build a system that will get you a [ __ ] house you know what I mean and and I know it's a seductive idea like you buy this coin you can become a millionaire and you know I'm not telling you if you follow my [ __ ] YouTube You'll Be A Millionaire that's not going to work like that but if we lose this fight you and your family will be [ __ ] I'm sorry I don't want to say like that but that is what it is you know this is not a fight where the winners make millions this is a fight for survival you know so you you would put crypto as a very discreet asset sort of class which is nothing like like you said housing or land or gold you wouldn't touch it with a barge pole I'm sure the reason I'm sure people probably say always sending [ __ ] because he's short the reason I'm sure is because I started to get asked to do a lot of interviews on crypto and I went on TV and radio and said I think it's [ __ ] and you know I'm a big believer that you shouldn't say [ __ ] you don't believe okay so if I'm gonna say something on the radio I've got my nuts on it okay I still trade every day right and the things that I say is going to happen I'm betting on them so I went I opened up and I went short crypto you know I went short crypto just just simply because to explain what that means it means I basically bet the price will go down and if the price goes down I made money and I've made some money on it going down and I'm still short because I think it will still go down um I don't consider myself to be a crypto Trader I'm just saying that because you know opinions are cheap okay I've got my nuts on this if it goes up I'm going to lose money so you know what I believe that's what I believe and you know I was one of the top Traders in the world and I'm a very successful Trader people don't have to believe me but that isn't for me that's a statement of intent and look I don't want to trade crypto I think it's [ __ ] and I think it takes away I think it's sucking the life out of a lot of talented young people and I've seen a lot of things do that in my time um and it's turning them into gambling addicts and I'm being very harsh in it here and I know people are going to come at me but I'm trying to save you money but seriously you know I'm just telling you what I believe you don't have to agree with me but look you know we're losing our houses here are you trading dog coins like you're going to play with us or you're going to play with that that's the way I see it last question you recently said my grand macro thesis Is that real interest rates have to stay low as we've said and that's because the rich of all the wealth and like saving as you've said now no matter how hard you work how smart you are if you come from quote the wrong family you'll probably never own property that is feudalism we're going back into a world of aristocracy capitalism's over so capitalism is over what does that mean it's a good quote first of all it's a great quote that's what we're ending on it um when I say capitalism is over I say capitalism is a big word people have different ideas what it means okay but for me and for what I think a lot of people from where I'm from believe capitalism is or should be is a system where if you [ __ ] work hard and you're talented and you go for it and you do your best and you get the good degree and you get the good job and you hit it you should not necessarily become super rich but you should have there for you a nice secure comfortable Life House family if you want it that's capitalism that is the way I know some people not agree with that but that is the way people where I'm from are raised to believe it's about a society where if you work hard if you do the right thing you will be sure yeah that is that is what we we are like raised to believe that we live in that kind of society and I live in a world now well look I've got a mate he's a big fan of yours by the way so be happy to be mentioned he works in fashion smart guy went to Central Martin's big fashion School Works [ __ ] hard you know he lives good money now it took him a long time to get there he lives with his parents saves up saves up saves up because he wants to buy a house but the [ __ ] house prices come up quicker than his [ __ ] his [ __ ] deposit does and now mortgage has gone up how's this guy going to get a house this guy's done [ __ ] everything you want him to do you know what I mean studied hard best university really gone for it worked worked worked saving up everything this guy doesn't even know if he's ever going to be able to afford a family so from and at the same time I've Got Friends buying houses because their mom gave him 400 Grand that's not [ __ ] capitalism that is an inherited Society we are moving away you know there was 30 40 50 60 years where you know my dad worked for the Post Office you know I grew up it's all pakistanis and Indians where I grew up right their grandparents came over from Pakistan from India from Kenya right just worked in shops you know some of them are cleaners and they've got properties now you know what I mean they're secure now that was possible in the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s and it is not possible anymore we've got smart bright hard-working kids going to the best universities doing everything they can and they will never own property so when I say capitalism is over that is what I mean because we have ended a society where Ordinary People can expect a good quality of life for working hard Gary what a pleasure mate thank you cheers
